<h1>Innovation, R&amp;D, and Technology Transfer</h1>
<p>Recent scholarship on defence R&amp;D explores the relationship between innovation, firm performance, sectoral dynamics, and stakeholder management across diverse contexts. Several studies specifically examine the optimal allocation and impact of R&amp;D expenditure. Su (2019) investigates the existence of an optimal R&amp;D intensity in Chinese defence enterprises, finding a non-linear relationship where sales growth is maximized at a particular threshold of R&amp;D spending; excessive investment yields diminishing returns, highlighting the necessity for balanced resource allocation <span class="citation" data-cites="Su_2019">(<a href="#ref-Su_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Su et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Similarly, Lambertini (2023) models the strategic interplay between industry structure and R&amp;D investment, concluding that maximizing innovation quality requires greater industry concentration than what would maximize aggregate R&amp;D efforts—a result that speaks to the importance of knowledge sharing, particularly in joint ventures <span class="citation" data-cites="Lambertini_2023">(<a href="#ref-Lambertini_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Lambertini 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In terms of financial performance, Callado-Muñoz (2023) analyzes Spanish defence firms and identifies that both military and dual R&amp;D investments have a substantial impact on profitability, with dual-use (civil-military) technologies playing an increasingly prominent role <span class="citation" data-cites="Callado_Mu_oz_2023">(<a href="#ref-Callado_Mu_oz_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Francisco José Callado-Muñoz et al. 2023</a>)</span>. This builds on her earlier work (2020), which uses cluster analysis to distinguish between military, civil, and dual-technology collaborations in Spain, noting their evolution over time and the strategic value of understanding collaboration dynamics to inform policy and foster SME and international participation <span class="citation" data-cites="Callado_Mu_oz_2020">(<a href="#ref-Callado_Mu_oz_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Francisco J. Callado-Muñoz et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Research on knowledge transfer and innovation highlights further complexities. Riebe (2020) employs social network analytics on LinkedIn biographies in the German defence sector, finding limited personnel mobility between the defence and civilian sectors and thus constrained knowledge spillovers, though demonstrating the utility of social media data for such measurement <span class="citation" data-cites="Riebe_2020">(<a href="#ref-Riebe_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Riebe, Schmid, and Reuter 2020</a>)</span>. Schmid (2022), using patent data and emergence detection algorithms, documents that technological emergence in military innovation peaked between 1996–2008—driven in large part by non-traditional vendors and individuals—and has since declined, encouraging policymakers to support diversity in organizational contributors to sustain innovation <span class="citation" data-cites="Schmid_2022">(<a href="#ref-Schmid_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Schmid 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>At the firm level, Sachini (2020) analyzes the intellectual capital of Greek defence firms via bibliometric methods, revealing a growth in scientific output driven by a small subset of overperforming entities and individuals—signaling a concentration of knowledge and potential research hotspots relevant for strategic planning <span class="citation" data-cites="Sachini_2020">(<a href="#ref-Sachini_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Sachini et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, Balakrishnan (2022) focuses on the governance side, revealing that in Malaysia, effective defence R&amp;D is hindered by a lack of stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The study recommends open platforms, enhanced industry-academia ties, and sophisticated data analytics tools to foster a more integrated R&amp;D environment <span class="citation" data-cites="Balakrishnan_2022">(<a href="#ref-Balakrishnan_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Balakrishnan and Johar 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies underscore the multifaceted and context-dependent nature of defence R&amp;D: from the micro-level optimization of firm investments to broader sectoral and governance considerations, each with implications for national innovation strategies and policy frameworks.</p>

<section id="government-policy-and-regulatory-impact" class="level1">
<h1>Government Policy and Regulatory Impact</h1>
<p>The literature addresses the intersection of government intervention, policy reform, and economic outcomes in the aerospace and defense sectors across global contexts.</p>
<p>Zervos (2019) synthesizes various analytical approaches to elucidate the impact of government behavior and spending in aerospace and defense, particularly considering fiscal, trade, and security dimensions. Using trade and fiscal data from the US, Europe, and China, the study finds that security restrictions heavily limit FDI, and that government spending bolsters export performance in these sectors. However, these interventions are controversial due to their protectionist elements and implications for trade balances. The paper concludes that government policy is deeply intertwined with trade and fiscal patterns, creating a complex landscape where intervention is essential but not free from economic critique {<span class="citation" data-cites="Zervos_2019">Zervos (<a href="#ref-Zervos_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>In Spain, Callado-Muñoz et al.&nbsp;(2020) investigate the effects of legal reforms in defense procurement, analyzing panel data from Spanish contractors. Employing a differences-in-differences approach, they demonstrate that regulatory reforms enhanced the productivity—though not the profitability—of main contractors, especially after major legislative changes in 2011 and 2014. Productivity gains appear to result from R&amp;D investment, offsetting constrained profitability. The study concludes that legal reforms have improved industry health through increased productivity, although profit margins remain unimproved {<span class="citation" data-cites="Callado_Mu_oz_2020">Francisco J. Callado-Muñoz et al. (<a href="#ref-Callado_Mu_oz_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>The Chinese experience with civil-military integration (CMI) reform is examined by Yang et al.&nbsp;(2022), who utilize a quasi-natural experiment with propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimations. Their findings indicate that the 2015 CMI policy significantly increased the market value of military enterprises—most notably among firms with weaker innovation and governance capabilities and in less marketized regions. The results suggest that targeted government support, rather than blanket spending increases, is essential for industry advancement, particularly in private and less developed contexts {<span class="citation" data-cites="Yang_2022">Yang et al. (<a href="#ref-Yang_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Turning to broader policy design, Bellais (2023) critiques the legacy market structures of the defense industry, arguing they are ill-suited for contemporary security needs due to high entry barriers and incumbent favoring mechanisms. Through historical and theoretical analysis, the paper advocates for alternative industrial policies emphasizing modular architectures and open platforms to encourage innovation and new entrants, thereby increasing competition and effectiveness in defense capability deliveries {<span class="citation" data-cites="Bellais_2023">Bellais (<a href="#ref-Bellais_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>From a European perspective, Hartley (2023) presents an economic analysis of defense policy, highlighting inefficiencies stemming from political fragmentation and insufficient collaboration despite significant spending. Using economic and public choice theory, Hartley underscores that future policy must pivot towards collaborative, resource-pooled approaches to address technological and financial constraints, though significant political hurdles persist {<span class="citation" data-cites="Hartley_2023">Hartley (<a href="#ref-Hartley_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Finally, Bois (2024) discusses the push for more effective European defense spending in the context of geopolitical shocks such as the war in Ukraine and initiatives like the Strategic Compass. Through benefit-of-the-doubt models, case studies, and policy analysis, Bois illuminates the inefficiencies and ideological challenges confronting collaborative defense initiatives and calls for a strategic transformation in EU defense policy {<span class="citation" data-cites="Bois_2024">Bois and Buts (<a href="#ref-Bois_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies reveal the centrality of government intervention in shaping industrial performance, innovation, and collaborative efficiency in the defense and aerospace sectors, while also acknowledging the enduring challenges posed by political, structural, and market barriers.</p>

<section id="defense-industry-performance-and-productivity" class="level1">
<h1>Defense Industry Performance and Productivity</h1>
<p>The literature on the global defence industry reveals significant variation in firm performance, innovation, productivity, and strategic determinants across different countries and sectors. A central theme is the comparison of defence enterprises in China, the US, and Europe, as well as within specific sectors such as Spain’s defence industry and the US aerospace and defence sector.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="B_raud_Sudreau_2019">Béraud-Sudreau and Nouwens (<a href="#ref-B_raud_Sudreau_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> aims to provide robust estimates of Chinese defence enterprises’ military-related revenues and assess the effectiveness of China’s defence-industrial and innovation capacities in comparison to global counterparts. Despite Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ranking among the world’s leading defence firms by revenue, the study finds that they underperform in productivity and innovation. The firms’ rise is mainly attributed to government reforms, civil-military integration, and technology adoption from abroad. The article concludes that continued government strategies are necessary as these enterprises still face substantial gaps in efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>Through a domestic lens, <span class="citation" data-cites="Dom_nguez_S_nchez_2022">Domínguez Sánchez and Fonfría (<a href="#ref-Dom_nguez_S_nchez_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> investigates productivity determinants and trends in the Spanish defence sector. Using panel data analysis and advanced efficiency metrics, the study reveals very modest overall productivity growth (0.4%) from 2010–2017, with significant sectoral differences: the Missiles and Naval sectors experienced robust growth, while Armament and Space lagged. The research attributes productivity enhancement largely to efficiency improvements rather than technological advances and recommends refinement in resource use and industrial cooperation as key policy directions.</p>
<p>Addressing firm-level financial strategy, <span class="citation" data-cites="Koutoupis_2022">Koutoupis and Davidopoulos (<a href="#ref-Koutoupis_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> examines how dividend policy relates to earnings management within the U.S. aerospace and defence sector. The study finds a significant positive correlation: managers appear to manipulate earnings to maintain stable dividend payouts, thereby supporting the signalling hypothesis. This industry-specific evidence highlights the importance of corporate governance and suggests future research account for exogenous disruptions like COVID-19.</p>
<p>On broader international comparisons, <span class="citation" data-cites="Tzeremes_2023">Tzeremes (<a href="#ref-Tzeremes_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> applies Data Envelopment Analysis to assess sales performance among major global arms producers. The findings indicate US defence firms far outperform European counterparts, with modest overall industry sales growth but high performance variability. The study concludes that increased European defence budgets and collaborative policy, especially in R&amp;D and procurement, are crucial for improved competitiveness and economic growth.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="citation" data-cites="Belin_2024">Belin and Fawaz (<a href="#ref-Belin_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> delves into profitability dynamics of US and European defence companies over 2006–2020, identifying critical factors such as past profitability, debt policies, firm size, and degree of specialization in defence activities. US firms’ higher profitability is linked to their defence focus and concentrated market structure, while European firms’ profitability suffers from fragmented markets and greater dependence on civilian revenues. The paper argues that these strategic industry differences necessitate significant adaptation in defence policies and firm strategies across regions.</p>
<p>In summary, these studies collectively underscore the impact of strategic orientation, government policy, industrial structure, and financial management on the competitiveness and performance of the global defence industry, highlighting both the challenges and policy directions necessary for future growth and innovation.</p>

<section id="case-studies-and-comparative-analyses" class="level1">
<h1>Case Studies and Comparative Analyses</h1>
<p>The reviewed literature explores various aspects of national and global defense policy, defense industry structures, and trends in arms production across multiple contexts.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="De_Rezende_2019">De Rezende and Blackwell (<a href="#ref-De_Rezende_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> analyzes the implementation of Brazil’s National Defence Policy, specifically focusing on budget allocation and the reorganization of the Armed Forces. By utilizing data from multiple sources (World Bank, SIPRI, government institutions), the study finds that although defense expenditures increased, much of the budget was allocated to personnel and social security rather than modern equipment and technology. This approach, coupled with a focus on conscription, hindered technological advancement within Brazil’s military, leading to program delays and a risk of outdated defense capabilities. The study concludes that despite increased spending, the policy’s implementation was insufficient to achieve its intended goals, emphasizing the need for a shift in resource allocation priorities.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Zervos_2020">Zervos (<a href="#ref-Zervos_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> provides a comprehensive overview of the global defense industry through a series of national case studies using the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) analytical framework. The findings highlight the complexity and diversity of defense industries worldwide, shaped by unique national contexts but increasingly influenced by international collaboration and multinational corporations. The volume’s conclusion underscores the significance of these emerging economic and security themes and the value of a comparative, future-oriented perspective across different regions.</p>
<p>In the context of Sweden, <span class="citation" data-cites="Nordlund_2021">Nordlund (<a href="#ref-Nordlund_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> offers a contextual introduction to the nation’s defense sector, economy, and historical approach to neutrality and self-sufficiency. Drawing on demographic, economic, and defense organization data, the article identifies Sweden’s unique traditions—particularly conscription and domestic customization of defense equipment—alongside robust international partnerships. The Special Issue as a whole is positioned to enhance understanding of Swedish defense economics and to promote academic exchange internationally.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="citation" data-cites="Scarazzato_2024">Scarazzato et al. (<a href="#ref-Scarazzato_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> examines trends in global arms production, with particular attention to the effects of the war in Ukraine. Using quantitative data from the SIPRI Arms Industry Database, the study reports that despite an increase in demand driven by conflict, overall arms production revenue declined by 3.5% in 2022 due primarily to lingering COVID-19 production disruptions in US companies. However, substantial order backlogs and heightened demand suggest potential for future growth. The Ukraine war has further highlighted the importance of maintaining the capability to produce not just advanced weaponry but also essential war equipment that can be rapidly produced.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies illustrate both the persistent challenges and evolving priorities within defense policy and industry—whether in national contexts like Brazil and Sweden or on a global scale—as defense sectors navigate between personnel costs, technological modernization, institutional legacies, and the pressures of contemporary armed conflict.</p>
</section>
<section id="competition-consolidation-and-market-structure" class="level1">
<h1>Competition, Consolidation, and Market Structure</h1>
<p>The literature surveyed explores various dimensions of market structure, efficiency, and consolidation within the defence industry in both American and European contexts.</p>
<p>Mart Sempere (2019) seeks to illuminate the sources and consequences of market failures in the defence industrial market, using welfare economics as a guiding theoretical lens. The article finds that inefficiencies such as incomplete contracts, externalities, and agency problems proliferate due to departures from ideal market conditions. The study concludes that interventions—such as consortia or regulatory measures—can alleviate some of these failures, though careful design is required to prevent introducing new inefficiencies {<span class="citation" data-cites="Mart_Sempere_2019">Martí Sempere (<a href="#ref-Mart_Sempere_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Mahoney (2019) analyses the strategic advantages acquired by publicly traded U.S. defence firms, focusing on how their access to financial markets has enabled them to consolidate the industry. By leveraging IPOs and debt, these major contractors outpace privately held competitors in acquisition capacity, gradually reducing both competition and increasing concentration. While this centralization has rendered them integral to U.S. defence operations, the study highlights possible vulnerabilities stemming from overdependence on these large publicly traded firms, especially under adverse economic conditions {<span class="citation" data-cites="Mahoney_2019">Mahoney (<a href="#ref-Mahoney_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Turning to Europe, Kleczka (2020) investigates the potential for Airbus-like consolidation in the continent’s armoured vehicle sector. Using market concentration metrics and merger simulations, the study finds that while further mergers are plausible, an ‘Airbus of land systems’ is unlikely to emerge soon. Nevertheless, ongoing consolidation and collaboration could still yield dominant players within specific subsectors, reflecting gradual though uneven progress towards greater industrial integration {<span class="citation" data-cites="Kleczka_2020">Kleczka, Buts, and Jegers (<a href="#ref-Kleczka_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Finally, Bellais (2021) presents MBDA as an emblematic case of European cross-border industrial integration. By unifying previously fragmented capabilities via cooperative programs, MBDA has established itself as a specialized leader in the missile sector. However, progress is curtailed by fragmentation in the European regulatory landscape, indicating that deeper integration will depend on greater alignment at the policy level {<span class="citation" data-cites="Bellais_2021">Bellais (<a href="#ref-Bellais_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Across these studies, authors converge on the stubborn persistence of market failures and the decisive influence of financial, regulatory, and political structures on defence industry organization. Interventions in market structure, access to capital, and cross-border collaboration emerge as key levers shaping the sector’s evolution.</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-escalation-and-affordability-in-defense-procurement" class="level1">
<h1>Cost Escalation and Affordability in Defense Procurement</h1>
<p>The literature on cost escalation and innovation in military aircraft procurement provides substantial insight into historical and contemporary challenges faced by the UK and related European contexts.</p>
<p>A detailed historical analysis by Hartley examines Norman Augustine’s hypothesis of cost escalation in military equipment within the UK, focusing specifically on military aircraft between 1936 and 2003. The findings confirm continued, and in some cases underestimated, cost escalation—some aircraft types demonstrated cost increases even higher than the fourfold per decade rate postulated by Augustine. This trend has significant budgetary implications and points towards the need for explanatory models to understand the trends observed <span class="citation" data-cites="Hartley_2020">(<a href="#ref-Hartley_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hartley 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another case-based study investigates the practices surrounding affordability during the concept generation phase for future combat air systems. Amann et al.&nbsp;show that in both industry and defence authority cases, there was little evidence of explicit cost constraints guiding design decisions. Concept development was primarily incremental, and processes did not curb escalating costs. The authors argue that incorporating explicit affordability targets, encouraging innovative thinking, and using a wider tradespace could foster more cost-effective outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="Amann_2020">(<a href="#ref-Amann_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Amann, Kihlander, and Magnusson 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Turning to the mechanisms of change, Amann and colleagues conduct a historical analysis of the Gripen fighter project to understand how significant path changes can be realised in complex defence equipment development. Their analysis reveals that transformational change requires presenting organizations with challenging opportunities and motivators such as resource constraints and collaborative needs. Effective managerial alignment and customer communication of needs and constraints are identified as prerequisites for navigating strategic path changes towards curbing cost escalation <span class="citation" data-cites="Amann_2021">(<a href="#ref-Amann_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Amann 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Returning to historical cost structures, Hartley provides an in-depth regression analysis of UK fighter and bomber contracts from 1938 to 1964. His findings show that the industry achieves decreasing costs via scale but still experiences significant cost escalations between generations. Additional findings highlight the financial difficulties faced by new market entrants and an inefficiency in procurement, with profit margins higher in peacetime due to stricter controls during wartime <span class="citation" data-cites="Hartley_2022">(<a href="#ref-Hartley_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Hartley 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, these studies reinforce that unchecked technological innovation and procurement processes in military aviation tend to drive unsustainable cost escalation. Across different methodological approaches and datasets, the evidence calls for the adoption of more robust affordability management, explicit cost constraints, enhanced managerial alignment, and better communication between industry and defence authorities.</p>
</section>
<section id="procurement-processes-and-efficiency" class="level1">
<h1>Procurement Processes and Efficiency</h1>
<p>Recent literature critically examines diverse aspects of defense procurement systems across various national contexts, with a particular focus on the mechanisms and challenges influencing effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Melese_2018">Melese (<a href="#ref-Melese_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> investigates the costs and benefits of bid protest mechanisms within military acquisition, using a static, probabilistic microeconomic model rooted in U.S. Department of Defense data. The study finds that, although designed to minimize corruption and foster competition, bid protest systems can spur inefficiency, delays, high transaction costs, and even unintended fraudulent behaviors. The authors conclude that modifications or alternatives to the current system are warranted to better align with procurement objectives and minimize negative outcomes.</p>
<p>In the Indian context, <span class="citation" data-cites="Kundu_2019">Kundu (<a href="#ref-Kundu_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> applies quantitative and qualitative risk analysis on a substantial set of domestic defense contracts and interview data to identify critical risk factors undermining procurement performance. The findings point to technological challenges in indigenous projects as the leading source of delays, with post-contractual risks—especially opportunism with foreign suppliers—causing the greatest performance setbacks. The study recommends capacity-building in contract management and addressing infrastructure and resource limitations for indigenous endeavors as key mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Addressing the impact of offset policies in Indonesia over several decades, <span class="citation" data-cites="Maharani_2022">Maharani and Matthews (<a href="#ref-Maharani_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> leverages comprehensive historical and case study data to assess industrial and technological outcomes. Results reveal that, while these offset arrangements contributed to enhancing manufacturing and technical skills (notably in aerospace), their overall effect on job creation, export capability, and high-value technology transfer was limited. The study suggests that realizing broader development objectives depends on more structured and strategic offset policies.</p>
<p>Examining patterns of military aircraft procurement in Europe, <span class="citation" data-cites="Droff_2024">Droff et al. (<a href="#ref-Droff_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> utilizes a comprehensive multi-country, multi-market database to reveal persistent national divergences shaped by sovereignty and industrial interests, despite nominal efforts toward Europeanization. Market decisions reflect a preference for national champions in states with the relevant industrial base, while others look predominantly to transatlantic suppliers; the legacy of Soviet-era equipment shapes trends in Eastern Europe, although European suppliers benefit more than their American counterparts. The F-35 program exemplifies enduring U.S. influence. Overall, collective European strategies remain secondary to national imperatives.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies underscore that while defense procurement reforms, risk management innovations, and policy mechanisms (such as offsets or bid protests) are instituted with goals of efficiency, fairness, and technological advancement, they frequently produce complex, sometimes counterproductive, effects shaped by local political, economic, and industrial realities.</p>
</section>
<section id="defense-industry-market-dynamics" class="level1">
<h1>Defense Industry Market Dynamics</h1>
<p>The literature collectively examines the dynamics and behaviors present in the defence sector within capital markets, focusing on bubble formation, market agent behavior, and susceptibility to external shocks such as terrorist events.</p>
<p>Zhang (2018) investigates the existence and drivers of price bubbles in China’s defence sector from 2005 to 2016 using advanced econometric tests (ADF, SADF, GSADF) on monthly CSI National Defence Industry Index data. The study identifies four distinct bubbles in the defence sector and five in the broader stock market, attributing two major bubbles specifically to increased military spending and defence sector reforms. The findings suggest that both industry-specific and market-wide factors contribute to exuberant valuation episodes. The study recommends gradual defence reforms and moderate increases in military budgets to mitigate bubble formation, emphasizing the importance for policymakers to account for stock market effects and shifts in defence expenditure <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang_2018">(<a href="#ref-Zhang_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang, Xu, and Zhai 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Mart Sempere (2018) adopts an agent-based computational economics model to simulate the European defence industry market. By incorporating empirical data and observed micro-behaviors, the model explores how market agents react to alternative government policy regimes, such as free market conditions or discriminatory procurement. The model’s replication of actual market behaviors under different policy scenarios demonstrates its efficacy as a tool for assessing and improving policy design intended to foster industrial performance within the sector <span class="citation" data-cites="Mart_Sempere_2018">(<a href="#ref-Mart_Sempere_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Martí Sempere and Fonfria Mesa 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fraser (2020) considers the defence sector’s vulnerability to sudden changes in risk perception resulting from terrorist attacks. Using daily defence sector index valuations from 17 countries and the EU, and correlating them with terrorism event data, the study employs an event study methodology and regression analysis. The findings highlight that defence sector valuations react more significantly to specific characteristics of terror events than to broader economic factors. Notably, price responses persist for several days post-event, reflecting speculative investor behavior in anticipation of potential government actions <span class="citation" data-cites="Fraser_2020">(<a href="#ref-Fraser_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Fraser and Carbonnier 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, these studies underscore the defence sector’s complex interplay between policy, market structure, and external shocks. They highlight the need for nuanced policy-making and further research into the mechanisms underlying sectoral and investor responses to changing political and security conditions.</p>

<section id="military-expenditure-and-economic-impact" class="level1">
<h1>Military Expenditure and Economic Impact</h1>
<p>Recent scholarship has advanced our understanding of the interconnections between military expenditure, economic growth, and global power dynamics using varied perspectives and empirical techniques.</p>
<p>Addressing a gap in Marxist international relations theory, Kak (2021) investigates the relationship between military expenditure, economic growth, and profit rates from a Marxist perspective. By analyzing data from 1963-2008 across different countries and economic contexts, the book finds that military expenditure had significantly positive effects on profit rates prior to the neoliberal era, but these effects became negative afterward. Furthermore, the impact of military spending varies depending on a country’s economic position and its status as an arms importer or exporter. The study concludes that the economic consequences of militarism are contingent on historical and structural factors, underscoring the necessity for further Marxist inquiries into the role of militarism in political economy {<span class="citation" data-cites="Kak_m_2021">Kakışım (<a href="#ref-Kak_m_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>In the context of the United States, Callado-Muñoz (2022) explores the links between arms exports, labor productivity, and economic growth by applying the Diebold-Yilmaz Connectedness Index to annual data from 1950 to 2017. The findings show that shocks to military exports cause significant positive spillover effects on both labor productivity and GDP growth. Notably, the study finds these spillovers to be robust across different time periods and reveals that causality is unidirectional—from arms exports to productivity and growth, not vice versa. The conclusions support the export-led growth hypothesis and suggest that, despite shifting geopolitical landscapes, US arms exports yield consistent economic benefits that warrant recognition in policy considerations {<span class="citation" data-cites="Callado_Mu_oz_2022">Callado Muñoz et al. (<a href="#ref-Callado_Mu_oz_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Robertson (2024) turns to China, applying index number techniques to assess the size, growth, and structure of China’s defense budget compared to the USA, using a range of publicly available datasets. This methodological approach reveals that China’s real defense budget—when adjusted for purchasing power parity and appropriate price deflators—is about 60% higher than market exchange rate estimates, amounting to 59% of the US defense budget. The analysis highlights rapid growth in Chinese military equipment investment, although labor remains a prominent component of defense expenditure. The author concludes that China’s defense modernization and spending parity with the US are more pronounced than generally assumed, inviting a revision of prevailing narratives about global military balances and their economic implications {<span class="citation" data-cites="Robertson_2024">Robertson (<a href="#ref-Robertson_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>}.</p>
<p>Overall, these studies collectively stress that the economic impacts of military expenditure are multi-faceted and depend on historical period, national context, and measurement techniques. They advocate for nuanced approaches in future research on militarism and defense economics.</p>

<h1>Strategic Autonomy and Supply Chain Dependency</h1>
<p>The literature collectively examines the complexity and challenges facing European defence-industrial supply chains, strategic autonomy, and collaborative procurement models.</p>
<p>Matthews (2021) investigates the Eurofighter Typhoon’s collaborative supply chain, with a primary focus on the ‘juste retour’ policy, which mandates a proportional return of investment to participating countries. Drawing from case studies and a wide range of documentary sources, Matthews finds that this policy exacerbates inefficiencies and complexity by privileging national interests over competitive allocation, resulting in increased costs and bureaucratic entanglement. Nevertheless, the study notes that entrenched collaborative relationships have kept the programme functional, though future initiatives like Tempest might require a model that prioritizes economic efficiency rather than sovereignty (<span class="citation" data-cites="Matthews_2021">Matthews and Al-Saadi (<a href="#ref-Matthews_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Lundmark (2021) provides a historical and case-based analysis of Sweden’s defence-industrial posture, emphasizing its transition from comprehensive autonomy during the Cold War to a hybrid, partially autonomous framework. The study identifies techno-nationalism, strategic prioritization, and corporate lobbying as pivotal drivers in shaping this evolution. While Sweden continues to prioritize key defence capabilities, the article highlights the growing difficulty of achieving full autonomy due to foreign dependencies, suggesting that multilateral cooperation will be increasingly necessary moving forward (<span class="citation" data-cites="Lundmark_2021">Lundmark (<a href="#ref-Lundmark_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Kleczka et al.&nbsp;(2023) systematically examine the EU’s defence-industrial supply chains with regard to non-EU dependencies. Utilizing quantitative ownership data, procurement analytics, and supply chain mapping, the authors show that while non-EU ownership and participation are widespread, control is generally diffused and seldom concentrated in rival states. The research underscores entrenched dependencies on non-EU suppliers and firms for major EU defence projects. The study concludes that striving for full strategic autonomy would necessitate tough trade-offs and economic sacrifices, recommending further research into national strategies on foreign ownership and sector-specific analysis (<span class="citation" data-cites="Kleczka_2023">Kleczka et al. (<a href="#ref-Kleczka_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these works underscore that while strategic autonomy remains a central concern for European defence, practical and economic constraints compel various forms of hybridity and collaboration, with entrenched political interests and globalized ownership patterns rendering complete autonomy both difficult and costly. # Reference</p>
