\description{
Launches a Shiny gadget to upload and process academic PDFs related to
Defence and Peace Economics (DPE). It extracts structured metadata
including aims, data, methods, findings, conclusions, keywords, DOI,
JEL codes, and themes using a large language model.
}
\details{
The gadget:
\itemize{
\item Accepts multiple PDF files.
\item Uses Python functions (\code{py_pdf_blocks}, \code{py_count_tokens}) to extract raw content.
\item Applies an OpenAI GPT model via the \code{ellmer} package to extract structured fields.
\item Automatically checks for token limits and alerts the user if exceeded.
\item Displays a reactive summary table and allows the result to be downloaded as CSV.
}

Requires a working Python environment and properly configured \code{reticulate}, \code{ellmer}, and \code{dpe} packages.
}
\note{
Files exceeding 100,000 tokens will not be processed.
