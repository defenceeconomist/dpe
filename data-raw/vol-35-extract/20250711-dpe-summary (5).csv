"The paper aims to characterize the strategic relationship between various disinformation strategies — lying, leaking, seeding, and smearing — and to analyze how these strategies operate in different mediums and through different sources, especially in the context of the digital revolution.","The paper draws on historical and contemporary examples of disinformation strategies, such as Operation QKOpera during the Cold War, the Syrian gas attack incident, and the hacking of the DNC, among others.","The study employs a game-theoretic approach to model the interactions between a source of disinformation (with knowledge of the truth) and a target (with uncertainty about the information's truthfulness and the authenticity of the source).","The study finds that disinformation often neutralizes Bayesian updating because the target cannot ascertain the veracity of the information based on the medium or the revelation of the source's identity. The digital era has made seeding and smearing more effective than leaking and lying, as shown by increased social-media-as-disinformation, echo chambers, and the declining half-life of secrets.","The study concludes that disinformation strategies are most effective when targeting is sophisticated enough to bypass traditional gatekeeping. It emphasizes the need for intelligence gathering that emphasizes accurate priors over real-time information processing. For policy, understanding the environment where information fits within the target's worldview is crucial.","Security Economics / Issues","Cybersecurity and Intelligence","10.1080/10242694.2024.2302236","Disinformation; echo  chambers;  counterintelligence; half-life of  secrets; fake news; deception","D74; D82; C72"
"To present and analyze global arms production trends while assessing the impact of the Ukraine war on global arms production.","Data is derived from the SIPRI Arms Industry Database, which includes information about the world's largest arms-producing and military services companies from open sources.","Quantitative data from the SIPRI Arms Industry Database is used to track historical trends and analyze the arms industry's evolution, focusing on the top 100 arms-producing companies globally.","Despite the Ukraine conflict and rising global tensions, arms production revenue fell by 3.5% in 2022 due to lingering COVID-19 impacts on US companies' production. However, high demand and order backlogs suggest potential future revenue growth. The war in Ukraine highlights deficiencies and challenges in defense production scaling.","Arms revenue declined despite increased demand due to production challenges. Future growth is expected as backlogged orders are fulfilled. The need for less advanced but necessary war equipment has been emphasized by the Ukraine conflict.","Arms Trade (& Production)","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","10.1080/10242694.2024.2381784","Arms production; arms  industry; defence economics;  Ukraine","H56; H57; L11"
"The study aims to examine public attitudes on arms exports to governments that violate human rights, using a survey experiment conducted in Israel.","The data comes from an online survey experiment conducted with 1,824 Israeli respondents, recruited via the country's largest online survey company.","The study uses a survey experiment methodology, presenting respondents with vignettes describing arms sales scenarios with varying conditions related to human rights violations, economic and security ties, and types of weapons. Respondents were randomly assigned to different vignettes.","The study found that human rights violations significantly increase public opposition to arms sales, with a 21 percentage point increase in disapproval among informed respondents. Opposition was present even when the recipient country had economic or security importance to Israel. Concerns were similar for both conventional and cyber weapons.","The study concludes that there is a significant gap between public opinion and government policy on arms sales, with the public favoring ethical constraints that governments often overlook. Public concern for human rights in arms exports could provide leverage for stricter controls if harnessed by activists and policymakers.","Arms Trade (& Production)","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2225401","Human rights; arms trade;  public opinion; experiment;  Israel; cyberweapons",NA
"The study aims to investigate the connectedness among NATO and Russian stock markets, along with a set of three commodity indices (energy, precious metals, and agriculture) before and during the Russian-Ukrainian war.","The study uses daily data from January 2, 2017, to May 16, 2023, including stock market indices for Russia and 26 NATO member states, as well as indices for energy, precious metals, and agriculture commodities. The data is expressed in U.S. dollars.","The study employs time and time-frequency connectedness metrics using the frameworks developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik and Krehlik (2018), along with the ForceAtlas2 algorithm to visualize network connectedness before and during the conflict.","The findings indicate that the total connectedness among the markets ranges between 72.03% and 89.38%, with higher market integration observed during stress periods like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. NATO stock markets were more interconnected, while the Russian market became more isolated during the conflict, influenced by Western sanctions. Commodity markets like energy, agriculture, and precious metals were found to be efficient hedging instruments during the war.","The study concludes that geopolitical crises such as the Russian-Ukrainian war increase market interconnectedness, providing investors with potential strategies for hedging and diversification. The isolation of the Russian stock market reflects the effectiveness of Western sanctions. The study suggests further investigation into why specific markets became more interconnected or isolated during the conflict.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2277031","NATO stock markets; Russian  stock market; commodity  markets; Russian-Ukrainian  war","C01; D53; F51; Q02"
"The study investigates the impact of global geopolitical risk on the stock-bond relationships, specifically the time-varying correlations of Islamic stocks and sukuk returns, compared to conventional assets, in the GCC markets.","The paper utilizes daily data of GCC markets from 2013 to 2019, including indices for GCC Shariah stocks, sukuk, and conventional stocks and bonds. The geopolitical risk index from Caldara and Iacoviello (2018) was also used.","A multivariate GJR-GARCH model with dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) was used to analyze the co-movement of Islamic stocks, sukuk, and their conventional counterparts under geopolitical risk. Bivariate wavelet coherence plots were used to assess stock-bond correlation across different investment horizons.","The study found that geopolitical risks positively affect the stock-bond correlations in both Islamic and conventional markets, but through different volatility patterns. The volatility of conventional stock-bond correlation increases, while Islamic stocks-sukuk correlation volatility decreases under high geopolitical risks. Additionally, the geopolitical impact is more pronounced over long-term investment horizons.","Islamic stocks and sukuk provide diversification benefits due to reduced correlation volatility during high geopolitical risks, unlike their conventional counterparts. This suggests that Shariah compliance can lower asset connectedness during turbulent periods. Policymakers and investors in the GCC should consider these aspects for portfolio diversification.","Security Economics / Issues","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2023.2203477","Geopolitical risk; Islamic  assets; Stock-bond interplay;  GCC region; Multivariate  GARCH; Wavelets","H56; G1; G15"
"The aim of the paper is to evaluate the effects of civilian, military, and dual R&D investments on the profitability of firms, particularly focusing on firms collaborating with the Spanish Ministry of Defence.","The study uses a database comprising 935 observations from 158 firms that collaborated with the Spanish Ministry of Defence from 2011-2018. The database includes details about R&D activities and financial information.","The study employs the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to analyze the impact of civilian, military, and dual R&D investments on firm profitability.","The results show that military R&D is more significant than civilian R&D in explaining firm financial performance. It also reveals that dual R&D is becoming increasingly important, highlighting the relevance of technologies that can be adapted from civilian to military purposes.","The study concludes that military and dual R&D investments significantly impact the profitability of firms in the Spanish defence industry. It suggests that dual-use technologies are crucial for the Spanish defence sector, providing additional insights into the ongoing debate about R&D investments in defence.","Defence R&D and Technology","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","10.1080/10242694.2023.2197308","Civilian; military; R&D;  defence industry;  profitability of firms","O3"
"To investigate the relationship between industry structure, aggregate R&D activity, and the quality level of innovation within the defence industry using a stochastic game model.","Numerical calculations are performed as part of the model; no specific empirical data is mentioned.","A stochastic one-shot game model is developed where firms have an equal chance of innovating and winning a government contract, with industry structure affecting R&D efforts and innovation quality.","There is a concave and single-peaked relationship between aggregate R&D and industry structure. The degree of concentration maximizing innovation quality is higher than that maximizing R&D efforts unless a research joint venture allows free spillover of technical knowledge.","To maximize innovation quality, industry concentration must increase beyond the level that maximizes R&D efforts. Free knowledge exchange in industry-wide RJVs aligns the concentration needed for both R&D investment and innovation quality.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence R&D and Technology","10.1080/10242694.2023.2187931","defence industry; innovation;  concentration; technological  spillovers",NA
