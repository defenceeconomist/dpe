"The study aims to analyze collective action under the context of intra-group conflict, focusing on how group members allocate resources for both external conflicts and internal rivalries, and identifying the types of equilibria that emerge from such interactions.","The study uses theoretical models, particularly variations of the Colonel Blotto game, to simulate scenarios where players have fixed budgets and need to make strategic decisions.","The authors employ game theory, specifically Bayesian Nash equilibrium, to explore two-player competitive scenarios with incomplete information about budget sizes amidst intra-group and inter-group conflicts.","The paper identifies two types of equilibria: standalone and joint contribution. The former occurs when one player contributes enough for group success, while the latter requires contributions from both members. Each equilibrium type is found under specific budget conditions and carries different implications for strategic resource allocation during conflicts.","The study concludes that despite the inherent conflict over resources within an alliance, groups can often overcome collective action problems. Both types of equilibria exist under certain conditions, and their emergence depends strongly on the budget distribution and the external versus internal conflict dynamics.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Economics of Alliances","10.1080/10242694.2022.2151083","Blotto budgets; intra-group  conflict; threshold public  good; collective action; all-  pay auction; incomplete  information","D72; D74"
"The study aims to investigate the effect of public corruption on internal conflict in Iran using a corruption reflection index based on newspaper coverage.","The study uses annual data from 1962 to 2019, along with a novel corruption reflection index based on coverage in the Ettelā'āt newspaper, and conflict data from the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive.","The research employs a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model and applied tools of impulse response and variance decomposition analyses to examine the dynamic relationship between corruption and internal conflict.","The study finds a significant positive response of protests to positive shocks in the corruption reflection index. Economic growth and military spending are identified as main channels through which corruption can lead to increased internal protests.","The study concludes that corruption has a significant effect on internal conflict in Iran, with its effects mediated through impacts on economic growth and military spending.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2022.2108571","Corruption; protest; conflict;  newspaper coverage; Iran;  economic growth; revolution","D73; D74; O43"
"To investigate the impact of indirect state rivalries on the occurrence of civil wars and assess the role of military capacity in influencing internal conflicts by introducing a novel dataset.","New dataset developed on indirect state rivalry relations for 154 countries over the period 1970-2015.","The study employs matrix calculations, Social Network Analysis (SNA), a logit model, and methods like random forest algorithm and Kaplan-Meier estimate to confirm findings.","1) Both direct and indirect rivals significantly increase the risk of civil war. 2) Lower military capacity relative to rivals increases the risk of internal conflict.","A comprehensive examination of direct and indirect rivalries and military capabilities helps better understand the international influences on civil wars, offering insights into conflict dynamics for policy development.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Economics of Alliances","10.1080/10242694.2022.2129350","Civil wars; international  relations; indirect rivalries;  military capabilities","C33; H56; D74; N40; P48"
"This study aims to examine the long-term consequences of the civil war in Tajikistan on education and labor market outcomes, with a focus on the gendered impacts.","The study uses a nationally representative cross-sectional dataset collected in 2018 in Tajikistan, twenty years after the end of the civil war, which includes geographical information on the armed conflict from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset.","The study compares individuals who completed their mandatory schooling before the war with those who were of school age during the war. It uses variations in exposure to the armed conflict by region and cohort, and employs statistical analysis to identify differences in educational attainment and labor market outcomes.","The findings indicate a negative and significant effect on completing basic education for females exposed to the war during their school ages. Moreover, there are significant adverse effects on receiving cash wages for females exposed to armed conflicts during their basic education ages.","The study concludes that the civil war had long-term negative impacts on educational attainment and labor market outcomes, particularly for females. These effects highlight the lasting impact of armed conflict on gender inequality in education and employment.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Military Personnel & Recruitment","10.1080/10242694.2022.2141946","Tajikistan; civil war; long-  term consequences;  schooling; labor market  outcome; gender","Codes: D1; I2; O1; P2."
"The study aims to analyze the inclusion of gender provisions in civil war peace agreements, particularly focusing on empowerment versus victimization provisions and the conditions under which these provisions emerge.","Data was collected from civil war peace agreements occurring between 1990-2018 using the UCDP dataset for peace agreements and the Gender Peace Agreement Database (Gender Pa-X).","The study applies logit regression analysis to examine the conditions influencing the inclusion of gender provisions in peace agreements, utilizing V-Dem data, UCDP datasets, and various control variables.","Findings indicate that empowerment provisions are more likely in societies with higher levels of female political participation, whereas victimization provisions are more likely in conflicts with higher civilian victimization. UN mediation and power-sharing arrangements are also associated with higher inclusion of gender provisions.","The study concludes that despite the necessity, gender empowerment provisions are less likely to appear in peace agreements in societies with low women's political representation. Victimization provisions are included where they are most needed. UN mediation plays a crucial role in advocating for gender provisions.","Peace and Peacekeeping","Conflict & Civil Wars","10.1080/10242694.2022.2114058","Peace agreements; civil war;  gender inclusion; intrastate  conflict; mediation",NA
"To estimate the effect of the U.S. Army's decision to increase the service obligation for Army aviators from six to ten years on West Point cadets’ preferences for aviation as a branch.","Administrative cadet branching data from a sample of 7,412 West Point cadets from the Classes of 2015 through 2021, along with cadets' GPA, SAT scores, aviation branch scores, and demographic information.","The study uses a difference-in-differences identification strategy, comparing cadets' preferences from Classes of 2015-2020 to those in the Class of 2021 before and after the service obligation change, utilizing multiple preference sets as the treatment and control groups.","The increased service obligation made aviation less popular, reducing by 4.1 percentage points the percentage of cadets ranking aviation as their first choice and increasing the percentage ranking it among their lowest choices by 6.9 percentage points. The changes were most pronounced among cadets with high GPAs, aviation talent scores, and SAT scores.","The policy change decreased cadet preferences for aviation, particularly among high-aptitude cadets, which could impact the quality of future aviators. Despite this, more cadets still preferred aviation than there were slots available, suggesting retention strategies could mitigate these effects.","Military Personnel & Recruitment","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2022.2101199","Labor contract length;  military labor; occupational  selection; nonwage  amenities; military service  opportunity cost",NA
"To provide a quantitative analysis of military executions in the French Army during World War 1, examining the soldiers' profiles, temporal distribution of executions, and geographical differences in execution rates across French counties.","The analysis is based on the 'Shot in the First World War' database of the French Ministry of Defense, which includes records of 1,009 soldiers and civilians sentenced to death and executed during the war.","The study uses descriptive statistics to provide a statistical portrait of the French soldiers who were executed and employs regression analyses to explore the temporal distribution of executions and the geographical differences in execution rates across counties.","The analysis finds that a significant portion of executed soldiers were young, had working-class occupations, and were privates in the infantry. Temporal variations in executions were correlated with battles, while geographical differences in execution rates were related to local alcohol consumption and political participation.","Executed soldiers typically acted out of survival instinct during intense battles rather than pacifist motives. The study supports the view that harsh battle conditions and local societal factors, such as alcohol consumption, influenced the likelihood of executions.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Military Personnel & Recruitment","10.1080/10242694.2022.2120234","Military executions; World  War 1; French Army; military  history","N44; K14; K42; D74."
