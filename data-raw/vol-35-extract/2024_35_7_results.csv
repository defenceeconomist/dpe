McGuire was a foundational figure in defense economics, making significant theoretical contributions to the understanding of intelligence, deterrence, alliances, and arms races. His work emphasized the importance of graphical presentations in economic theory.","Martin C. McGuire's death is a significant loss to the field of economics, particularly defense economics, where his theoretical contributions have had a lasting impact. His legacy is marked by his role in shaping the field and influencing policy through a theoretical lens.","Defence and the Economy","Public Choice & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2024.2399084",NA,NA
"The article aims to explore why states might choose strategic ambiguity in the form of an entente over formal military alliances when facing common threats. This choice is examined through the lens of collective action problems, considering the balance between deterrence, entrapment, and freeriding.","Historical examples such as the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance, as well as theoretical models, are used as data points to analyze alignment strategies and understand the dynamics between alliances and ententes.","The research employs a formal theoretical model rooted in the collective action framework to compare the strategic effectiveness of alliances versus ententes. It also analyzes historical case studies to contextualize theoretical findings.","The study finds that ententes can be more effective than formal alliances in balancing against powerful threats by maintaining strategic ambiguity. This ambiguity can reduce freeriding, which often plagues formal alliances. Additionally, the preference for ententes varies based on the symmetry of the participating states' power.","The article concludes that the choice of entente over formal alliance can help address collective action problems such as freeriding and can serve as a strategic tool to maintain flexibility and ambiguity in international relations. Ententes can allow states to manage their alignment commitments more dynamically and avoid the rigid obligations of formal alliances.","Economics of Alliances","Public Choice & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2023.2213468","Alliance; entente; collective  action; freeriding; contest  model",NA
"The paper aims to determine the true size, growth, and composition of China's defense budget over two decades and compare it to that of the USA, using index number techniques to provide a clearer picture of China's real defense spending and purchasing power.","The study uses publicly available budget data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China's local currency data, and price indices from the World Bank and other sources.","The paper employs index number techniques to quantify China's real defense spending, including the construction of price deflators and military purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates to compare real trends and spending levels with the USA.","The findings indicate that China's real defense budget is 60% larger than market exchange rate valuations, equating to 59% of the USA's budget. China's real spending has been characterized by rapid growth in military equipment, although its overall military remains labor intensive compared to the USA.","The study concludes that China's defense modernization has resulted in significant equipment growth relative to personnel. Its real defense spending and purchasing power suggest a closer parity with the USA than typically perceived, implying potential strategic and economic implications for global defense policies.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2024.2342043","Military spending;  International security; China;  purchasing power","F5; C43; H56; 053; P52"
"The paper aims to review trends in space weapon systems and analyze the implications of anti-satellite (ASAT) military weapons for human activities in outer space, particularly focusing on the increase in orbital debris and the potential long-term effects of space militarization.","The paper uses data from historical events, including specific ASAT weapons tests conducted by nations such as the United States, Russia, China, and India. It includes figures from past tests detailing the number of debris fragments generated, as well as historical pollution data in low Earth orbit (LEO).","The authors employ a simple physical-economic model to assess the impact of ASAT tests on orbital debris and a simulation to explore the long-term effects of a military conflict in space. They extend a model first developed by themselves in 2021 to include military shocks, representing ASAT tests or wars in space.","The findings indicate that anti-satellite tests significantly exacerbate the issue of orbital debris, increasing the risk of collisions in space and potentially accelerating the Kessler syndrome. Their model demonstrates that the destruction of satellites during conflicts greatly increases debris, which could have catastrophic long-term consequences for human activities in outer space.","The paper concludes that the weaponization of outer space could turn it into a contested domain akin to a battlefield, with severe negative implications for both military and civilian space activities. The proliferation of ASAT weapons and the resulting increase in orbital debris pose significant risks to space environmental security and may threaten the viability of sustained human activities in space.","Arms Races, Arms Control & Disarmament","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2208020","Outer space; anti-satellite  weapons; orbital debris; war  in space","D62; F51; H56"
"The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of sovereign debt default for a panel of twenty developing nations over the period 1970 to 2019, specifically focusing on the influence of defence/military spending.","Country-year panel data from 20 developing countries from 1970 to 2019, using data from the Bank of England and Bank of Canada's sovereign default databases, World Development Indicators for military expenditures, and macroeconomic and political indicators from various sources.","The study used ordered probit and multinomial logistic regression models to analyze the determinants of sovereign default according to different levels of default severity in the examined countries over fifty years. It incorporated the square of military-related variables to assess non-linear effects.","The findings indicate that increased military spending generally reduces default risk, but excessive military spending past a threshold increases the probability of sovereign debt default. Democratic levels and foreign currency reserves are negatively linked to debt default risk, whereas factors like external debt and short-term debt to reserves ratio are positively linked to higher default risk.","Military spending is linked to a decrease in the probability of default up to a certain extent, beyond which it increases the default risk. More democratic countries and those with higher foreign reserves see reduced default risk. Policies should consider adjusting military spending and managing short-term debt to reduce the risk of default.","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2023.2188386","Defence spending; default  risk; sovereign debt; political  factors; determinants","C23; F34; F52; H56; H63"
"To analyze the bilateral relationships between military spending among Southeast Mediterranean countries (Greece, Turkey, Israel, Egypt) from 1962 to 2020, accounting for nonlinearities and thresholds in military expenditure that may signal a threat to neighboring countries.","Yearly data for military expenditure as a percentage of GDP for Egypt, Greece, Israel, and Turkey from 1962 to 2020. Data was obtained from SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.","The study applies Threshold Autoregressive methodologies, kink regression analysis, and asymmetric cointegration techniques (Enders and Siklos' approach) to investigate the presence of nonlinearities, cointegration, and causality in military spending relationships between countries.","The study found that military spending relationships among the examined countries (Greece-Turkey, Israel-Egypt, Israel-Turkey) are nonlinear and cointegrated, indicating a long-run equilibrium without evidence of an arms race. Positive shocks lead to unilateral adjustments, and threshold levels of military spending elicit significant responses from other countries, termed security thresholds.","There is no evidence of arms races among examined countries; rather, each country reacts to military spending of others above certain thresholds without mutual escalation. This suggests space for peaceful solutions in the region. Countries should consider the signaling effects of their military spending on neighbors when determining their defence budgets.","Arms Races, Arms Control & Disarmament","Regional Economics & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2023.2241122","Arms race; military  expenditure; nonparametric  methods; kink regression;  asymmetric cointegration  analysis","C24; F32; Η56"
"The study aims to quantitatively explore the relationship between defense spending, military technology, and modernization of the armed forces in Spain from the late 19th century to the eve of the Civil War, focusing on their interconnections and the role of patents as an indicator of innovation in military technology.","The study uses historical data on defense spending from the Spanish State Account Books (Cuentas del Estado Español) and a constructed index of modernization (based on the ratio of equipment to personnel expenditures). It also analyzes data on military patents registered in Spain between 1891 and 1935, sourced from the historical database of the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office.","The research employs a vector autoregressive (VAR) model analysis to examine the causal relationships between defense spending, military technology (as measured by patents), and modernization of the armed forces. Additional disaggregations of the data are used to identify impacts based on the origin, applicant type, and value of patents.","The study finds that defense spending did not Granger-cause military patents, but rather, military technology through patents appeared to precede defense spending. It also reveals a positive effect of military patents on the modernization of the armed forces, particularly highlighting the significance of foreign patents in influencing both spending and modernization.","Technological innovation tends to precede rather than follow defense spending in the Spanish case. The findings suggest the importance of foreign technology in both defense procurement and modernization efforts. While indigenous innovation plays a role, especially in attracting more advanced foreign technologies, robust technological capacity appears crucial for effective modernization. The study highlights the value of maintaining technological awareness and diversification of sources for military advances.","Defence R&D and Technology","Military Personnel & Recruitment","10.1080/10242694.2023.2198912","Military technology; patents;  defense spending; military  modernization; Spain; VAR  models","H56; O31; O34; N43; N44"
"This study aims to examine the relationship between Spain's military expenditure and economic growth from 1954 to 2021, focusing on the effects of military spending on economic growth and its variations across different political regimes in Spain.","The study uses annual time-series data from 1954 to 2021 for Spain's GDP, military expenditure, civilian spending, population, openness to trade, and gross capital formation. Data sources include the Central Bank of Spain, SIPRI, World Bank's Development Indicators, and the Penn World Tables.","The study employs the Dynamic Autoregressive Distributive Lag (DARDL) simulations and Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) methodologies to test for short and long-run relationships between military expenditure and economic growth. It also uses the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) tests to examine the stability of these relationships.","The study finds a positive short and long-run relationship between military expenditure and economic growth in Spain during the entire study period. However, this positive relationship is only significant during the non-democratic regime years (up to 1974), and turns negative in the democratic period (1975 onwards). KRLS results show non-linear and heterogeneous effects of military spending on economic growth.","The study concludes that military expenditure has distinct economic impacts depending on the political regime in Spain. The findings suggest that while military spending can stimulate growth in the short term, its positive impact is less apparent in the long term, especially under democratic regimes. Policymakers need to balance military spending with economic growth objectives.","Defence and the Economy","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","10.1080/10242694.2023.2245698","Spain; economic growth;  military spending; DARDL,  KRLS","C22; H30; O40"
"To examine the impact of civil conflict on cross-border lending, disaggregated at a sectoral level, using micro-level lender data on syndicated loans.","Data on syndicated loans from 165 countries during 1984-2019, taken from the Dealscan database, and data on civil conflict from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.","An empirical analysis using a Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) approach with sector-specific lender-level loan data and various control variables for macroeconomic and institutional factors. The study includes robustness checks using instrumental variables estimation.","Civil conflict does not significantly affect cross-border lending in the primary sector, which includes natural resources extraction. However, it negatively impacts lending in the secondary and tertiary sectors, causing a decreased volume of loans or reversals of existing loans.","Cross-border lending varies by sector during civil conflicts, with primary sector lending being stable due to steady revenues from natural resources, while secondary and tertiary sectors experience decreased lending due to increased risk and instability. Policymakers should focus on reducing civil conflict to attract cross-border lending in non-primary sectors.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2023.2205311","Cross-border lending; civil  conflict; economic sectors;  syndicated loans; volume of  loans","D74; F34; F51"
