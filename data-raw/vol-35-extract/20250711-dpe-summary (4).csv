"To examine the European Union's call for increased and more efficient defence spending, particularly in light of the Strategic Compass and the impact of the war in Ukraine.","Defence spending data from NATO, sales performance of European and US defence companies, and strategic autonomy data in EU defence supply chains.","Various methodological approaches, including a Benefit-of-the-Doubt model via Data Envelopment Analysis, case studies on procurement choices, and policy analysis.","The special issue outlines inefficiencies in current defence spending, highlights the fragmentation of the European Defence Industrial Base, and discusses increased defence budgets and investment in military equipment among NATO members, with Poland being a significant example.","The call for more collaborative defence spending in the EU faces practical and ideological hurdles, and the Strategic Compass should aim to transform into a cohesive strategy rather than being ineffective.","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","10.1080/10242694.2024.2349887","Defence spending;  procurement; defence  industry; European Defence  Industrial Base","H56; H57; L11; L64"
"To evaluate the sales performance of major European defence industries in comparison with other major international arms producers using a Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD) model via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).","The analysis uses data from SIPRI's top 100 arms-producing companies in the world database, focusing on 72 firms from the period 2016–2020.","The study employs a Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD) model via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This method constructs a composite sales performance indicator from 'arms sales' and the 'rest of sales' sub-indicators using a window-based DEA framework.","The findings show that US defence manufacturers dominate among the largest global producers, outperforming many major European companies. Overall sales performance levels in the defence industry have slightly increased over the evaluated period, although there are high fluctuations among companies.","The study concludes that significant increases in European defence budgets and procurement spending could boost the performance of European defence industries, providing economic growth and technological progress. The pursuit of collaborative European defence policies and investments in R&D is essential to address gaps in competitiveness and capability.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2223017","Defence industry; European  defence; DEA; BoD model",NA
"The study aims to analyze the profitability (ROA) of US and European defense companies to determine the influence of various factors including past profitability, debt policy, size, and specialization in defense activities. It seeks to understand why US defense firms are, on average, more profitable than their European counterparts.","The study uses the SIPRI Top 100 ranking data from 2006 to 2020, combined with economic and financial information (balance sheets and income statements) from the Orbis database. The sample consists of defense companies from the US and Europe.","The study employs a dynamic panel data approach using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system estimator to handle potential endogeneity and persistence in profitability. It analyzes the effect of various factors like past profitability, debts, size, specialization, and rank on ROA.","US defense companies show higher profitability compared to European ones. Specialization in defense positively influences US companies' profitability, while European companies are more affected by the civilian market. Past profitability, debt policy, and company size are significant determinants across both regions. European market fragmentation negatively affects profitability.","The superior profitability of US defense firms is partially explained by their specialization in defense activities and market concentration. European companies face profitability challenges due to market fragmentation and dependence on civilian markets. Changes in strategic and economic environments necessitate adaptations in defense systems in both regions.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","10.1080/10242694.2024.2329865","Profitability (ROA); defense  companies; GMM system  estimator; SIPRI","D53; C20; H56; F59"
"To study the dependency of the EU’s defence-industrial supply chain on non-EU entities and provide insights into the spectrum of strategic autonomy through dimensions of ownership, tender success, and supply chain participation.","Ownership data from the ORBIS database and European Defence industrial firms, EU27 public procurement data from the DIGIWHIST project, and supply chain data from the Airframer Supply Chain Directory.","Utilized quantitative analysis of ownership data, econometric analysis of public procurement data, and data analysis of supply chain involvement in multinational European defence programmes.","Non-EU shareholders own a significant portion of leading EU defence firms. Although partial non-EU ownership is prevalent, control is usually dispersed and not centralized in adversarial nations. Non-EU firms participate actively in EU defence-related M&A and tenders, indicating strategic dependency, notably in high-value contracts. Non-EU suppliers are crucial for major EU defense projects, reinforcing entrenched non-EU influence.","While efforts to bolster EU defence-industrial autonomy are ongoing, complete strategic autonomy is currently unattainable. Dependency on non-EU entities is deep-rooted and involves significant industrial collaborations. Achieving strategic autonomy would require difficult trade-offs and potential economic costs. Further study is suggested in areas like national strategies on foreign ownership and in different sectors beyond aircraft projects.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2180588","Defence industry; EU  strategic compass; European  Defence Technological and  Industrial Base (EDTIB);  supply chain dependency;  industrial policy","L60; L64; F50"
"The paper aims to discuss the grounds for a defence industrial policy adapted to the current stakes of international security, focusing on the need for an alternative approach to complement existing policies in order to foster innovation and competition while addressing evolving threats and operational needs.",NA,"The paper utilizes a historical and theoretical analysis of market structures, competition, and innovation within the defence industry, particularly focusing on large arms-producing countries and the institutional setup resulting from the Cold War period.","The current defence market organization is characterized by institutional structures that emerged during the Cold War, which are no longer fully adequate to address the evolving operational needs of armed forces and the dynamic security environment. The existing market structure limits innovation and competition due to high barriers to entry, reliance on incumbent suppliers, and self-reinforcing barriers that favor existing technology trajectories.","An alternative defence industrial policy is necessary to address the limitations of the current market structure. More modular architectures and open platforms can increase the reactiveness of capability deliveries, foster innovation, and attract new suppliers, thus enhancing competition in the defence market. The paper suggests that restructuring market incentives and reducing barriers to entry could lead to more effective defence capabilities.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2182869","Armament; R&D; technology;  procurement; industry","H56; H57; O32"
"To measure and discuss the continuities and changes in the military aircraft procurement process in Europe, examining the influence of national preferences related to sovereignty, industrial issues, and strategic needs on procurement strategies.","The study analyzes procurement decisions across four aircraft markets (fighter aircraft, transport aircraft, helicopters, UAVs) in 30 European countries during the post-Cold War era. It builds a comprehensive database spanning 1995-2020.","The study uses comparative analysis across four distinct aircraft markets based on both qualitative and quantitative data. It employs historical procurement decision analysis, market entry cost evaluation, and fleet composition analysis using various economic, strategic, and industrial indicators.","European countries display significant heterogeneity in procurement strategies, with a lack of coordination. Countries with industrial capacity prioritize national benefits, while others opt for transatlantic suppliers. Former Soviet states phase out Soviet aircraft at varying rates, benefiting European suppliers more than American ones.","Europeanization of the defense aircraft market is limited; nations remain driven by national sovereignty and industrial benefits rather than collective European strategies, despite some cooperative production. American influence persists, as evident in procurement trends, particularly due to the F-35 program.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2271816","Military aircraft; Europe;  procurement strategies; path  dependency","H56; H57; L64; O52"
"To provide an economic analysis and critique of European defence policy, focusing on the opportunities for more efficient spending and the challenges posed by political factors.","Defence spending and capability data are presented in tables showing national contributions, major arms firms, and collaborative projects from sources like NATO and SIPRI.","Economic analysis is employed, utilizing economic efficiency criteria such as final outputs, substitution, and competition, in addition to public choice theory to analyze political factors influencing European defence policy.","The paper finds that European defence policy is fraught with challenges like political fragmentation, duplication, and insufficient collaboration. Despite numerous initiatives, military and industrial collaborations remain politically driven rather than economically efficient, hampering potential improvements.","Future European defence policy must adapt to evolving technological and budgetary constraints. There needs to be a greater focus on economic efficiency through collaboration, specialization, and pooling of resources, though political barriers remain substantial.","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","10.1080/10242694.2023.2185425","Economic efficiency; joint  projects; public choice;  collective action","H56; H57; L24; L93; P35"
"The article aims to examine whether the European Union and its Member States have experienced a 'zeitwende' or turning point in their defence policy and cooperation in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","The analysis within the article is based on a range of policy decisions and implementations post-Ukraine invasion, including the use of the European Peace Facility, European Defence Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act (EDIRPA), and NATO's new strategic initiatives, with references to various academic and policy sources.","The article utilizes a qualitative method of analysis based on the assessment of recent policy frameworks, strategic documents, and defence initiatives adopted by the EU and NATO, comparing past aspirations with current implementations and realities.","The article finds that although the EU has taken unprecedented steps to support Ukraine militarily, these have not been matched by significant advancements in European defence cooperation or integration among EU Member States.","The article concludes that despite the EU making important strides, a comprehensive and efficient European defence integration remains elusive. It stresses the need for genuine multinational cooperation to maximize defence capabilities, suggesting that existing frameworks could be leveraged to create permanent multinational force packages.","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","Economics of Alliances","10.1080/10242694.2023.2201739","European Union; NATO;  defence","Y20"
