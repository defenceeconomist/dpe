"To explore whether prospect theoretical findings require a reconstruction of classic deterrence theory, specifically examining their impact on strategic decisions in deterrence games.","The paper uses theoretical game models, such as the Mutual Deterrence game and, more specifically, probabilistic assessments related to prospect theory, though the exact real-world data is not explicitly provided.","Mathematical analysis of deterrence games using prospect theoretical assumptions to examine changes in strategy probability distributions, compared to standard game-theoretic assumptions.","The analysis shows that while prospect theory does lead to some changes in the dynamics of deterrence games, it does not fundamentally alter the preference order of player strategies. Prospect theory may help explain specific cases, such as risky strategic decisions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but it does not necessitate a complete overhaul of deterrence theory.","Prospect theory offers valuable insights as a supplementary tool in analyzing game strategies under deterrence but should not replace standard game-theoretic models. The marginal changes identified by prospect theory do not justify reconstructing a deterrence theory specifically based on it. Nevertheless, prospect theory provides a framework for thinking about biases and strategic decision-making contexts.","Arms Races, Arms Control & Disarmament","Conflict & Civil Wars","10.1080/10242694.2022.2152956","Deterrence theory; game  theory; prospect theory",NA
"The paper seeks to determine whether wargames are appropriate for predictive purposes or are better used as intuition training devices, focusing on the information and incentive problems within the practice of wargaming.","The research utilizes work by military scholars, declassified wargame reports, Government Accountability Office reports, and investigative journalism to illustrate the problems in wargaming.","The paper applies an economic analysis of information and incentive problems within the practice of wargaming, exploring how these problems manifest in real-world wargames and using insights from political economy.","The research finds that wargames are plagued by persistent information and incentive problems that greatly diminish their reliability for predictive purposes. These issues result in wargames being more suitable as intuition training devices rather than reliable predictive models.","The split between using wargames for predictive purposes and as training tools should be resolved in favor of the latter, as leveraging wargames for predictions often leads to suboptimal defense decisions due to ingrained information and incentive issues.","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","Public Choice & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2022.2145537","Wargaming; national  defense; information  problems; incentive  problems","D83; F50; H56"
"To explain the motivations behind China's innovation efforts and whether they are driven by external threats ('creative insecurity') or offensive ambitions ('creative ambition').","Quantitative data including China's R&D intensity and Militarized Interstate Disputes data from the Correlates of War project. Qualitative data includes historical analysis of China's policy changes and innovation efforts.","A mixed methods approach combining qualitative historical analysis and quantitative regression analysis using China's R&D intensity and Militarized Interstate Disputes as variables.","The study finds some support for the hypothesis that external threats increase China's innovation efforts ('creative insecurity'), but also notes that R&D efforts increased even when external threats decreased, suggesting a role for offensive ambitions ('creative ambition').","China's innovation efforts are driven by both 'creative insecurity' due to perceived external threats and 'creative ambition' as it seeks to expand its global influence. These dual motivations suggest a complex interplay influencing China's strategic policy and economic behavior.","Defence R&D and Technology","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2022.2155903","Politics; innovation; China;  security; ambition;  technology",NA
"To analyze trade policy for a private market good that serves as a dual-use technology, valuable for military force production, and to establish conditions for optimal trade policy interventions in such contexts.","Theoretical model based on historical examples (e.g., U.S. and England post-American Revolution).","Theoretical two-country model with contested and uncontested resources, using a Ricardian framework of trade and conflict.","The optimal trade intervention involves a quota and subsidy combination by the importing country, which increases home production efficiency. The importing country's total surplus increases with a subsidy from the exporting country.","The study concludes that a production quota paired with a production subsidy is optimal for the importing country to increase its efficiency and contested resources. It emphasizes the need for empirical analysis to measure the marginal effects of contested resources.","Arms Trade (& Production)","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2022.2145645","Trade; Tariffs; Dual-Use  Technology; Strategic  Competition; Quotas",NA
"To analyze the negative externalities associated with hiring private military companies (PMCs) from an economic perspective, and to discuss options for internalizing these externalities.","The study relies on documented case studies, literature reviews, and theoretical frameworks from economic theory, particularly externalities.","An instrumental case study approach is employed to gain insights into the specific negative externalities of PMCs. The research involves a literature review to identify negative externalities and the use of well-documented cases as examples.","Two main negative externalities were identified: the violation of national and international law by PMCs and the circumvention of the legislative branch by the executive in client states. The study finds that these externalities can potentially be internalized using transparency measures and command-and-control regulations at national and international levels.","Negative externalities of PMCs, such as legal violations and executive circumventions, require specific interventions to internalize them. Effective measures include supranational and national regulations to create transparency and accountability, particularly involving supranational organizations like the UN for oversight in operational areas.","Private Military Companies","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2022.2126213","Private military companies;  external effects; regulation",NA
"To examine the determinants of public debt in Nigeria from 1970 to 2020, with a focus on the effects of armed conflict, arms imports, and military spending.","Annual time series data from 1970 to 2020 for variables including government gross debt, external debt, domestic debt, military spending, arms imports, real GDP, fiscal position, inflation, and oil price. Data sources include the World Development Indicators and SIPRI database.","The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration, allowing for estimation of both long-run and short-run relationships between the variables.","Conflict, arms imports, and military spending have statistically positive effects on external debt, but not on domestic debt. Conflict and arms imports positively affect gross government debt. Control variables such as national income, fiscal position, inflation, and oil price also play significant roles in debt dynamics.","Conflict and military spending are significant determinants of external debt in Nigeria. Thus, managing conflict and military spending is crucial for addressing the country's external debt issues. Policy recommendations include financial discipline and addressing socio-political issues to manage debt sustainability.","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","Conflict & Civil Wars","10.1080/10242694.2022.2145709","Total public debt; external  debt; domestic debt; socio-  political factors; Nigeria;  conflict",NA
"The paper aims to uncover the economic effects of the most important components of the US defense budget from 1949 to 2021 using a Barro-style regression analysis.","The study utilizes data on US military budget components including Military Personnel, Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) from the National Defense Budget Estimates for FY2022, as well as GDP and other economic indicators from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.","The research employs linear and non-linear methods, specifically using a Barro-style regression model and the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach to analyze the asymmetric effects of military spending components on GDP.","The analysis shows that military spending, especially on personnel and procurement, has high opportunity costs. In the short run, military spending can positively influence GDP, but long-run effects are generally negative. Negative changes in military outlays are economically advantageous, leading to potential GDP increases.","The study concludes that reductions in military spending, particularly in personnel and operations, may benefit the US economy. The findings suggest that military budget expansions are not beneficial for sustained economic growth, aligning with the principle of the 'peace dividend.'","Defence and the Economy","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","10.1080/10242694.2022.2145717","US military budget;  economic output; time series  analysis","C32; E62; O11; O51"
