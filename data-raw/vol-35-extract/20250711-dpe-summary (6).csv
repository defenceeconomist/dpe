"This study assesses the immediate effects of four significant events during Afghan peace talks on district-level averages of violent incidents and fatalities in 2018-2020.","Uses the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) dataset, spatially merged with Afghanistan's district boundaries, to analyze violent incidents and reported fatalities at the district level.","Employed a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) design and event study analysis to test game-theoretic predictions and to highlight affected districts.","The initiation of US–Taliban talks escalated violence; however, the cancellation of talks and US–Taliban deal agreement reduced violence. Despite an initial decrease after meetings, violence recommenced or increased slightly, suggesting a short-lived reduction. The GoIRA–Taliban meeting reduced attacks by Afghan forces temporarily.","Peace negotiation events have mixed effects on violence levels: they can decrease conflict temporarily but often result in resumed or increased violence later. The results underscore the complexity and volatility in peace negotiation contexts.","Peace and Peacekeeping","Conflict & Civil Wars","10.1080/10242694.2023.2285461","Afghan war; US withdrawal;  Taliban; negotiations; peace  talks","D74; F51"
"To utilize satellite data, specifically nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration and nightlight intensity, to monitor changes in economic activity in Sudan resulting from the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).","Satellite data on NO2 concentrations and nightlight intensity from the Sentinel-5P satellite is used, alongside historical economic activity data from 2022 as baseline indicators.","The study employs spatial and temporal analysis of satellite-derived NO2 and nightlight data to track changes in economic activity patterns before and after the initiation of the conflict. It compares changes in these indicators between conflict-affected and non-conflict areas in Sudan.","The study finds a decline in NO2 concentration and nightlight intensity in areas affected by the conflict, indicating reduced economic activity, whereas areas less affected by conflict maintain stable levels or show slight increases due to displacement and migration.","Remote sensing data, such as NO2 concentration and nightlight intensity, can provide valuable real-time insights into the impact of armed conflict on economic activities, helping to inform humanitarian and development policy responses in conflict-affected regions.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2290474","Sudan armed forces; rapid  support forces; conflict;  economic activities; NO 2  concentration; nightlight  intensity",NA
"To examine the variation in self-determination (SD) organization violence against other SD organizations and determine if ethnic population inequality (WPI) influences this violence, especially when an SD organization has previously used violence against the state.","Survey-based data on ethnic population inequality (WPI) from 1992 to 2005 and data on violence between SD organizations.","OLS regression analysis is used to assess the relationship between WPI and violence between SD organizations, considering covariates, interaction effects, and various robustness checks such as subset analysis, matching techniques, and tests for reverse causality.","Higher WPI is associated with an increased probability of SD organization violence against other SD organizations, particularly in contexts where an SD organization has recently used violence against the state. The findings hold across different model specifications and tests for omitted variable bias.","Ethnic population inequality (WPI) significantly influences intra-SD movement violence, especially when conditioned by previous violence against the state. This suggests that economic factors and SD-state interactions have meaningful consequences for intra-SD organization violence.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2247509","ethnic conflict; self-  determination; violence;  inequality",NA
"To examine the correlation between Syrian refugees' legal residency and their labor force participation in Lebanon, using the VASyR dataset and a Probit model to analyze the impacts of legal residency on employability.","The study uses the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) dataset, which consists of a random sample of 11,413 respondents from Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon.","Empirical analysis using a Probit model to examine the likelihood of employment among Syrian refugees, focusing on legal residency as a key independent variable. The analysis also considers identity documentation and demographic factors.","Syrian refugees with legal residency are more likely to be employed in Lebanon. Legal residency ensures freedom of movement and facilitates access to work permits. Identity documentation such as IDs and passports is also positively associated with employment. Among different demographic factors, being male and married increases the likelihood of employment, while education levels do not show significant impact on employability.","The legislation in host countries, such as complex processes and high fees for obtaining legal residency, adds burdens to refugees' vulnerabilities. Simplifying these processes and reducing fees could enhance their employability. Local integration of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is not currently viable; therefore, focusing on resettlement might be necessary to ensure their rights to work are maintained.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2228578","Legal residency; Work;  Demographic factors;  Identity documentation;  Probit","J61; K37; N45"
"This study examines the effects of civil conflicts in Burundi on its economic performance, focusing specifically on the 1993-2003 civil war.","The data includes GDP per capita, investment rates, and other economic indicators for Burundi and comparison countries from 1970 to 2003.","The study uses a structural VAR model to estimate the structural effects of civil conflicts on economic growth, and the Synthetic Control method to quantify the economic costs of the 1993-2003 civil war on GDP per capita.","The study finds that civil conflict in Burundi has a lasting negative impact on economic growth, resulting in a cumulative 7.1% decrease over ten years and a decline of approximately USD 138 in GDP per capita per annum during the war period.","The costs of civil conflict in Burundi are substantial, amounting to approximately USD 1514 per person and nearly USD 10 billion for the country. These findings emphasize the importance of peacebuilding for economic development.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2023.2232971","Conflicts; fragility; GDP  growth; GDP per capita;  burundi; synthetic control  method","C22 ;  C99 ;  E00 ;  O47"
"The aim of this research is to challenge the findings of Benmelech et al. (2015), which claimed that punitive house demolitions were an effective deterrent against suicide bombings during the Second Intifada, by addressing modeling errors and confounding factors in their analysis.","The research utilizes data from B’Tselem, covering district/locality and monthly information on punitive house demolitions during the Second Intifada, as well as data on suicide bombings and other related security measures such as arrests, curfew days, and Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities.","The study employs econometric analysis, particularly correcting the econometric model used by Benmelech et al. (2015) by accounting for both monthly national shocks and district/locality monthly shocks. The paper uses Poisson regression models and controls for various confounding factors.","The paper finds that when properly accounting for confounding factors such as national and district-locality level shocks, the supposed deterrent effect of punitive house demolitions on suicide bombings is statistically insignificant. Arrest campaigns were found to have a more substantial impact on reducing suicide bombings.","The research concludes that the deterrence effect of punitive house demolitions suggested by previous studies is spurious, with other factors like excessive state oppression and the glorification of martyrdom playing a significant role in motivating suicide bombers. It suggests that state-led repression strategies are not effective deterrents in the context of asymmetric conflict.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Terrorism","10.1080/10242694.2023.2289000","Punitive house demolition;  suicide attacks; deterrence;  grievance; revenge","F5; K4; I0"
"The primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of geopolitical risks (GPR) on trading patterns within Latin America, focusing on the influence of US and China as key economic players.","The study uses monthly GPR index data from 2000 to 2020, capturing geopolitical risk from the US, China, and Latin American countries. Additionally, quarterly GDP and monthly trade data (imports and exports) are sourced from the World Bank.","The study employs a gravity model and uses robust least square models and impulse response functions to estimate the impact of geopolitical risk on trade patterns. It analyzes trade dynamics by looking at both direct and indirect effects of GPR on trade between Latin America, the US, and China.","The findings underscore a negative impact of GPR on trade, particularly affecting imports. The US GPR has a direct adverse impact on trade with Latin America, while GPR from China affects Chinese imports. The study reveals variations in vulnerability among individual Latin American countries, with some being more susceptible to country-specific risks.","The study concludes that geopolitical risks have a significant negative impact on trade between Latin America and its major partners, the US and China. It highlights the need for policymakers to consider GPR in trade policy formulation and the potential benefits of firms adopting risk management strategies to mitigate GPR impacts.","Security Economics / Issues","Regional Economics & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2023.2299072","Geopolitical risk; trade flows;  international trade;  emerging economies; Latin  America","F14; F36; F62; F23"
"The study aims to investigate the interplay between geopolitical risk and trade protectionism, specifically how geopolitical considerations impact trade protectionist measures.","Trade protection data from 26 countries and the geopolitical risk index were used in the study.","The study formulates a trade protection network using geopolitical risk index and employs regression analysis with additional instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns, using data from the Global Trade Alert (GTA) database and other sources.","The study finds that geopolitical risks increase the tendency of countries to engage in trade interventions. Countries with high institutional quality, diverse political systems, and reliance on foreign trade are more likely to impose trade restrictions due to geopolitical tensions. Additionally, multilateral cooperation organizations exert different levels of influence over trade protectionism.","Geopolitical risk significantly influences trade protectionist measures, requiring countries to enhance domestic monitoring, foster international collaboration, and establish new frameworks for international trade. Additionally, institutions and political systems moderate the impact of geopolitical risk on trade protection.","Security Economics / Issues","Arms Trade (& Production)","10.1080/10242694.2024.2364320","Geopolitics; trade  protectionism; multilateral  co-operation organisations;  tariffs; trade barriers","D81; F13"
