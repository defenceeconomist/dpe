"The aim of the special issue is to provide an economic analysis of NORAD and its modernization, focusing on aspects such as economic theories of alliances, burden sharing, and public choice theory.","The analysis relies on existing models and tools in defence economics, and in some articles, burden sharing is assessed using defence expenditures and conceptualizing NORAD's 'production function'.","The articles employ economic theories of alliances, burden sharing assessment, and the joint product model. Some analyses include Input-Output framework to quantify GDP and employment impacts.","The special issue finds Canada reaping significant benefits from NORAD with a relatively small burden. The modernization of NORAD has the potential to provide both private and public benefits through enhanced technological capabilities and economic activity for local communities.","The special issue calls for more focus from defence economists to address complex economic and strategic dynamics involving NORAD, emphasizing the need for a re-evaluation of homeland defence due to emerging threats.","Economics of Alliances","Defence R&D and Technology","10.1080/10242694.2024.2349888","The economics of alliance;  joint product model; public  choice; NORAD; burden  sharing","D74; H42; H56"
"To extend the joint-products model of military alliances by allowing for two types of defence inputs used to produce both an alliance-wide public defence output and a country-specific private output, focusing on the NORAD case.",NA,"Theoretical modeling using economic alliance theories to incorporate two defence inputs (technology and land) into the joint-products model, and deriving conditions under which allies adjust their contributions of these inputs in response to changes by other allies.","Distinguishing between defence inputs changes the predictions of the joint-products model. Conditions are identified under which allies adjust their contributions of technology and land in response to changes by others, showcasing different incentive structures compared to the traditional one-input models.","Multiple defence inputs create more nuanced incentive structures than traditional one-input models. In alliances like NORAD, this requires considering the complementarity and distinct roles of technology and land in defence production. The model predicts how allies will reallocates these inputs depending on their productivity and complementary roles.","Economics of Alliances","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2209772","NORAD; public goods; joint  product model of alliances;  free riding","D74; H41; H56"
"This study aims to quantify the burden sharing between the United States and Canada in the context of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).","The data includes military expenditures from 1972 to 2020, GDP, population, exposed borders data from CIA's World Fact Book, and other datasets such as OECD's R&D spending and military expenditures from SIPRI.","The study uses economic theories of military alliances, notably the Joint Products Model and the 'among-ally' burden concordance measure, to analyze the burden sharing dynamics, using military expenditure data disaggregated into capital, labor, and R&D components.","The analysis reveals that the US shoulders a disproportionate amount of the bi-lateral defense burden, while Canada receives a larger net benefit. However, a disaggregated view of military inputs shows a more balanced burden sharing.","The study concludes that improving institutional issues and fulfilling commitments outlined in Canada's Defence Policy ('Strong, Secure, Engaged') will help address the burden sharing debate. It also highlights the necessity for Canada to increase defense spending and improve institutional capacities to support NORAD modernization.","Economics of Alliances","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2232974","burden sharing; NORAD,  joint product model of  alliances; exploitation  hypothesis; benefit-burden  concordance; free riding","D74; H42; H56"
"The study aims to examine the economic impacts of modernizing the North Warning System (NWS) with respect to regional economic benefits, particularly focusing on Canada’s northern territories and Labrador.","The study utilizes data from socioeconomic studies, DND estimated expenditures by electoral district, Departmental Results Reports, and government’s Public Accounts. It includes multiplier data from Statistics Canada's Input-Output models and draws on various historical documents related to NORAD and NWS.","The study employs a combination of theoretical and empirical analysis, utilizing Input-Output models to estimate the economic impact of different scenarios regarding NWS modernization. It examines socio-economic reports, electoral district spending data, and uses GDP multipliers to forecast economic impacts.","The study identifies scenarios showing varying potential economic impacts of NWS modernization. It outlines that modernization can lead to significant regional economic benefits, including increased GDP and job creation, depending on policy decisions concerning the involvement of northern communities and Inuit engagement.","Conclusions suggest that while specific local impacts cannot be detailed due to data limitations, broader economic benefits are evident under various scenarios. Policy decisions regarding the extent of modernization, community involvement, and indigenous engagement will influence the overall economic outcomes.","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","Regional Economics & Defence","10.1080/10242694.2024.2328432","NORAD; alliances; economic  Benefits","D74; H42; H56"
"The article examines the private economic benefits to Canada from the NORAD Modernization project, focusing on technology transfers and the role of Canadian industry in the project.","The paper discusses emerging technologies, key industrial capabilities (KICs), and the Canadian defence industry's potential role in contracts related to NORAD Modernization.","The article uses the joint products model of alliances to analyze potential private benefits to Canada from the NORAD project. It maps industrial requirements to Canada’s key industrial capabilities.","The NORAD Modernization project can potentially generate significant private benefits to Canada, such as modern technology transfers and increased contract opportunities for technologically advanced Canadian firms.","If Canada fully participates in the NORAD Modernization project, the country stands to gain from technology absorption and economic benefits due to contract awards, enhancing its defence and industrial capabilities.","Economics of Alliances","Defence R&D and Technology","10.1080/10242694.2023.2228565","NORAD; private economic  benefits; alliances; Joint  products model",NA
"To conceptualize and operationalize proto-insurgencies as a precursor to civil war, distinguish between proto-insurgency formation and its escalation to civil war, and to identify the factors that contribute to these processes, particularly focusing on how state repressive violence influences proto-insurgency escalation to civil war onset.","The study utilizes annual data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to count the number of terrorist attacks in the decade before civil war onset, alongside Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP) data for civil war onset, and other indicators such as state repression and political context variables from sources like the CIRI Human Rights Data Project and Global State of Democracy Indices.","The research employs a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model to jointly estimate proto-insurgency formation and civil war onset. Data is analyzed for 110 developing countries over multiple years, using a variety of political, social, and economic indicators to predict both proto-insurgency and civil war onset.","Proto-insurgency formation is associated with political persecution and mid-range levels of repression, while escalation to civil war is driven by high levels of state repressive violence. Countries experiencing proto-insurgencies are more diverse than traditional models suggest, but those that escalate to civil war often experience high levels of indiscriminate repression.","The study concludes that state repressive violence is the main driver for proto-insurgency escalation to civil war, suggesting that traditional civil war onset models may overemphasize poverty and political structure while underestimating the role of repression. Future research should focus on how state responses to proto-insurgency violence affect the likelihood of civil war onset.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Terrorism","10.1080/10242694.2023.2183346","Proto-insurgency; civil war  onset; repression; terrorism;  group civil liberties",NA
"The study aims to explore the asymmetric effects of positive and negative commodity export price shocks on civil conflicts, specifically the impact on battle deaths during ongoing civil wars. It hypothesizes that negative price shocks can increase conflict, while positive shocks might not reduce conflict or could potentially increase it, especially in countries with weak pre-conflict institutions and a reliance on fossil fuels.","The data consists of an annual panel of countries with ongoing civil wars from 1970 to 2008. The measurement for conflict intensity is based on battle-related fatalities data from Lacina and Gleditsch (2005). Additionally, commodity export and import prices are analyzed using the Commodity Terms of Trade (CTOT) index.","The paper uses quantitative methods including regression analysis. It estimates the effects of positive and negative commodity price shocks on battle deaths using a panel dataset, controlling for conflict-episode fixed effects, region-specific year effects, and episode-specific quadratic time trends. The study employs the Commodity Terms of Trade (CTOT) index to measure price shocks and tests for asymmetry using interaction terms.","The findings indicate that negative commodity price shocks increase battle deaths, while positive shocks also contribute to higher battle deaths, particularly in countries with weak pre-conflict institutions and positive price shocks to fossil fuels. The study supports the hypothesis of asymmetric effects of commodity price shocks during civil conflicts.","The study concludes that both negative and positive commodity price shocks can exacerbate conflicts, particularly in countries with weak institutional frameworks and dependency on extractible resources. It suggests that institutional reforms, economic diversification, and price stabilization could mitigate the adverse effects of commodity price shocks on civil conflict.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2191535","Commodity terms of trade;  commodity prices; conflict;  institutions; resource curse","D74; Q02; Q34"
