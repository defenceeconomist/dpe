"The paper aims to develop a composite security burden measure for the NATO alliance, incorporating military expenditure, foreign assistance, and UN peacekeeping spending, and to investigate free riding among NATO allies within this broader security context.","The analysis uses data from the years 1991 to 2020, focusing on 28 NATO member countries' military expenditures, official development assistance, and UN peacekeeping contributions. Additional data includes GDP per capita, population, non-state conflict incidences, transnational terrorist attacks, and geographical metrics among others.","The authors employ a spatial-lag panel model and a panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to address endogeneity concerns and analyze interdependencies in security spending among NATO allies. The spatial models incorporate membership, contiguity, and inverse distance as weight metrics for inter-country analysis.","The analysis finds robust evidence of free riding among NATO allies, whereby individual countries tend to decrease their aggregate security spending when other allies increase their collective security spending. This behavior is consistent across models based on NATO membership, allies' contiguity, and inverse distance.","The study concludes that broadening the definition of security spending to include foreign assistance and UN peacekeeping does not eliminate free riding among NATO members. The findings suggest that even a more comprehensive measure of security burden sharing reflects systematic free riding, unaffected by ally-specific adjustments or contributions.","Economics of Alliances","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2023.2230408","NATO; Security burden  sharing; Peacekeeping and  foreign assistance; Spatial  econometrics; Endogeneity","D74; H56; C21"
"This study aims to develop a model analyzing the impact of NATO's approach to multi-domain operations (MDO) on member countries' behavior from the perspective of the economics of alliances, focusing on cross-domain synergy.",NA,"The study uses organizational and public economics methods, specifically focusing on public goods aggregation technologies and supermodular games to represent complementarity between defense activities in multiple domains.","Cross-domain synergies in MDO create complementarity between defense activities across different domains. This complementarity can make defense burden-sharing among NATO allies fairer, encouraging cooperative behavior rather than free-riding.","NATO’s approach to MDO, by incorporating cross-domain synergies, can lead to more equitable defense burden-sharing among member countries. The defense activities in different domains become complementary, motivating members to increase their defense capabilities in various domains, aligning with the collective goals of the alliance.","Economics of Alliances","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2023.2235502","multi-domain operations;  cross-domain synergy; NATO  burden sharing;  complementarity; weaker-  link; supermodular games",NA
"The study aims to understand why some governments succeed in reducing military spending after a civil war ends in a negotiated settlement, while others do not. It posits that a third-party verification mechanism for peace accords can help reduce military spending.","Data from 32 civil wars with comprehensive peace agreements between 1992 and 2011 were used. The military expenditure data came from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) database.","The study employed ordinary least squares regression with fixed effects models. It used peace-agreement-specific fixed effects to account for time-invariant factors and conducted a series of robustness checks, including matching techniques to control for the background factors.","The results indicate that the initiation of a third-party verification mechanism leads to a decrease in military spending in post-conflict societies. The effect was robust across multiple robustness checks.","The study concludes that third-party verification mechanisms facilitate the implementation of peace accords, indirectly reducing military expenditures, which can contribute to post-conflict peace and economic development.","Fiscal (& Budgetary) Effects of Defence Spending","Peace and Peacekeeping","10.1080/10242694.2022.2158648","Military expenditure; civil  war; verification mechanism;  peace agreement;  negotiated settlement",NA
"To investigate the relationship between conflict trajectories and education outcomes, with a focus on gender differences in schooling years in India, particularly examining areas affected by Naxalite violence.","The study uses panel data from the India Human Development Survey (2004/05-2011/12) and conflict data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP).","Propensity score matching methods on panel data to capture the dynamic nature of conflict, examining sensitivity with different measures of conflict, selective migration, and transmission mechanisms through both demand- and supply-side factors.","Conflict is associated with a reduction in years of schooling, with a more significant impact on girls, particularly in areas of chronic conflict. Mechanisms include potential deprioritization of girls' education in household spending and destruction of school infrastructure.","Policy responses should prioritize girls' education in chronic conflict areas, acknowledging the differential impact of conflict trajectories and emphasizing both supply- and demand-side factors in addressing education outcomes.","Conflict & Civil Wars","Security Economics / Issues","10.1080/10242694.2023.2164913","Conflict trajectories;  education; gender; India","I240; D7; J1"
"To examine the impact of global geopolitical risk (GPR) on the returns and volatilities of US Treasuries, differentiating between long- and short-run investment behaviors across various time-to-maturities, while considering economic and financial factors.","Monthly data from February 1986 to December 2018, including US Treasuries yields covering maturities from 1 month to 30 years, geopolitical risk measures, and nine economic and financial factors.","Utilizes a panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to analyze the short- and long-run impacts of geopolitical risk on US Treasuries’ returns and volatilities, while controlling for various economic and financial factors.","There is a negative long-run relationship between US Treasuries’ returns and the global GPR index, and a positive long-run relationship between the realized volatilities of US Treasuries and geopolitical risk. The impact of 'bad' volatility is stronger than 'good' volatility, indicating an asymmetric effect. The results hold across sub-sample analyses.","Geopolitical risk significantly influences US Treasury returns and volatility, providing valuable information for fixed-income investors and Federal Reserve policymakers in predicting yields and managing risks.","Security Economics / Issues","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2022.2150808","Global geopolitical risk;  threats and acts; long- and  short-run effects; returns and  volatilities; US treasuries  yield curve",NA
"To investigate the impact of the civil-military integration (CMI) reform policy on the performance of Chinese military enterprises, specifically examining how this policy influences the market value of these enterprises.","The study uses a dataset of Chinese A-share listed firms spanning from 2007 to 2017, consisting of 22,547 firm-year observations after excluding finance and insurance firms and companies with missing data.","The study employs a quasi-natural experiment design using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences models to examine the effects of the CMI policy. It also uses regression analysis, including ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares methods, to test hypotheses about the impact of CMI on market value and innovation ability.","The implementation of the CMI policy in 2015 led to a significant increase in the market value of military enterprises, on average by 6.682%. The positive impact was more pronounced in firms with lower innovation capabilities and weaker corporate governance. The effect was also stronger for firms with fewer financial constraints and in regions with lower marketization levels.","The CMI policy improves the performance of military enterprises by enhancing innovation abilities and corporate governance. This reform offers long-term support through better resource allocation, indicating benefits in policy decisions over just increased spending. Government-targeted support is crucial, especially for regions with lower marketization levels and privately operated military enterprises.","Defence Industries & Industrial Base","Defence Policies, Planning & Management","10.1080/10242694.2022.2154926","Civil–military integration;  military firm performance;  quasi-natural experiment","C3; G3; M4"
"The paper aims to develop the concept of comprehensive geopolitical risk (GPR) by expanding the definition of geopolitical risk to include both explicit and implicit risks, and to examine how this comprehensive geopolitical risk affects foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows from China to other countries.","The study utilizes FDI data from the Cross-border Greenfield Investment Database, macroeconomic and institutional quality data from the World Bank's World Development Index, and political risk data from the PRS' International Country Risk Guide. It constructs a comprehensive geopolitical risk index using big data from a news report database (GDELT).","The study employs Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood regressions with multiple fixed effects to estimate how comprehensive geopolitical risk impacts FDI outflows. It uses big data to construct geopolitical risk indexes and tests these against FDI flows from China.","The study finds that comprehensive geopolitical risk negatively impacts FDI outflows from China, especially in the energy sector. Implicit geopolitical risk also significantly deters FDI outflows. Moreover, geopolitical risk actions have a more significant negative impact than geopolitical threats.","Comprehensive geopolitical risk, including implicit risks, significantly deter FDI outflows from China. Geopolitical risks in the energy sector are more impactful, reflecting increased sensitivity due to national security concerns. This finding suggests a need for multinational enterprises to account for non-explicit geopolitical factors in their investment strategies.","Security Economics / Issues","Defence and the Economy","10.1080/10242694.2022.2160140","Geopolitical risk; foreign  direct investment; measuring  indexes; implicit geopolitial  risk","F21; D81"
