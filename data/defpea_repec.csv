"ReDIF-Article 1.0","Hans Kammler","Hans","Kammler","Not for security only: The demand for international status and defence expenditure an introduction","The analysis of military expenditure, inside alliances as well as outside, has gained much when the original Olson-Zeckhauser approach was generalized into the joint-product model of alliances as developed by Todd Sandier and others. This model allowed, as benefits to allies determining military expenditure, not only deterrence, a pure collective good, but partially collective goods like conventional fighting power and private (country-specific) benefits. The papers in this Special Issue explore the explanatory potential of also considering the demand for positional goods, in particular great-power status, as a determinant of military expenditure. The &#x201c;exploitation of the strong by the weak&#x201d; characterizing NATO until the early 1970s and during the American defence buildup of 1980-1985 might also be explained by an informal leader-follower bargain between the United States and its allies who traded acceptance of American hegemony for military protection and &#x201c;hegemonic stability&#x201d; of the world economy.","Defence and Peace Economics","1-16","1","8","1997","Positional goods, great-power status, credibility, leader-follower bargain, hegemonic stability, military expenditure,","10.1080/10430719708404866","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719708404866","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:8:y:1997:i:1:p:1-16",NA,NA

After World War II, France became a more modest State, but with de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic a new form of &#x201c;policy of grandeur&#x201d; was developed, based on nuclear deterrence, the importance of military expenditure, the independence of the national armament industry and arms exports. Since the mid-nineties, there has been a profound change of French defence policy, concerning the definition of means and the organization of armament production. European co-operation no longer appears as one option among others but as the only way out. For France, European co-operations is now placed at the centre of defence policy.

Critics charged that the expenditures were made without the benefit of a strategy for how best to use the increased resources and that defense procurements were wasteful. For a time, Secretary Weinberger's administration of the defense department was seriously questioned as lacking any strategic vision. This paper argues that these criticisms have merit, but fail to take into account the political context - both domestic and international - in which the Reagan Administration was operating. The defense build-up fit into a larger national strategy and as such cannot be understood in isolation. This national strategy is discussed and the role played by the Reagan military build-up in the conclusion of the Cold War considered.","Defence and Peace Economics","57-76","1","8","1997","Defense spending, Reagan foreign policy, military build-up, euromissile, zero option, strategic defense initiative, defense budgets,","10.1080/10430719708404869","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719708404869","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:8:y:1997:i:1:p:57-76",NA,NA

It concludes that both Eisenhower and Kennedy for political purposes proposed bigger defense expenditure to Congress than they thought was justified from a military standpoint. Both were strongly influenced in their decisions by political and psychological considerations related to the credibility of the United States as a superpower and security guarantor. The importance of military expenditure as a signal of resolve grew parallel to the end of the age of American invulnerability. With the advent of mutual nuclear plenty, the impact of public - and in particular allied - perceptions on defense budget decisions multiplied. The fact that both Eisenhower and Kennedy perceived military expenditure as a means to reassure allies and deter adversaries put them into an essentially defensive position in their effort to contain bureaucratic and domestic political forces in favor of a larger defense budget.","Defence and Peace Economics","77-100","1","8","1997","US military expenditure, missile gap, Sputnik shock, US defense budgetary process, Eisenhower defense budget, Kennedy defense budget,","10.1080/10430719708404870","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719708404870","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:8:y:1997:i:1:p:77-100",NA,NA

Except for the Reagan defense build-up in the early 1980s, actual defense burdens are not significantly different than average derived defense burdens. There is little sign of the exploitation hypothesis during this flexible-response era. In the 1990s, peace-keeping missions perform more like a pure public good and display some evidence of the exploitation of the large ally by the small. NATO foreign assistance abides by the joint product model and does not imply exploitation. Dramatic changes in the 1990s appear to reinforce the tendency towards equitable burden sharing, experienced from the start of the flexible-response era.","Defence and Peace Economics","101-121","1","8","1997","Post-Cold War era, joint product model, peace-keeping, exploitation hypothesis, foreign assistance, conscription, flexible response, public good,","10.1080/10430719708404871","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719708404871","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:8:y:1997:i:1:p:101-121",NA,NA

Build-up costs for such a capacity are estimated as 200-400bn ECU or an increase of about 50% to the defence budgets of NATO Europe of 1995. In relative terms this would mean defence expenditures of 2.8-3.8% of GDP, which seems tolerable compared to figures of the 1970s and 1980s. For the EU budget this would mean, however, not only nearly tripling but an increase from 1.3% to 4.8% of GDP. While other economic costs are marginal, the political costs for such a fundamental change in the EU's character, for reversing political trends in defence spending, and for transferring sensitive national sovereignty to the EU and the risk for public support, party cohesion, and elections are considerable. These political costs and potential risks have to be compared with benefits of becoming a second global power, of becoming independent from US security, and from major positive effects for EU integration in general.","Defence and Peace Economics","123-143","1","8","1997","European Union (EU), Common European Armaments market, common Foreign and Security Policy, european defence budgets, military capacity of EU, West European Union (WEU),","10.1080/10430719708404872","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719708404872","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:8:y:1997:i:1:p:123-143",NA,NA

For the best error components representation, greater growth enhancement is associated with the two forms of public spending in Asia than in Latin America, while the opposite comparison characterizes private investment.

Investment in military equipment was set to grow, policies were drawn up to foster the domestic defence industrial base, defence R&D rocketed, and Spain joined a myriad of international arms development programmes. Yet, by 1991 the process of reform had run out of steam. Expenditure planning proved unreliable, and firms suffered from sharp cutbacks in procurement expenditure. The model of defence industrial growth sketched in the mid-1980s had floundered. The Spanish case provides an example of how the quest to maximise defence procurement from domestic sources can fall victim to industrial and budgetary constraints.

Their respective defence burdens (i.e. the share of military expenditure to GDP) are the highest in NATO. Their bilateral relations are marred by serious friction and conflict of interest and have on a number of occasions come close to an armed confrontation. Their strategic interaction and mutual weapons build-up has recently attracted the attention of researchers in the field testing the hypothesis of a Greek-Turkish arms race with conflicting results. This paper, using cointegration and causality tests, finds evidence of a systematic armaments competition between the two countries provided that a defence policy regime shift estimated to occur in 1985 is explicitly taken into consideration.

The 'defence organisation' and 'industry' are the two principal parties involved in procurement transactions.

Thus, defence planners must determine not only their materiel requirements but also defence-related manufacturing and service capabilities needed in-country. But how much 'self-reliance' is feasible and desirable, especially in smaller countries?

"ReDIF-Article 1.0","Stefan Markowski","Stefan","Markowski","Switzerland - The pragmatic approach to defence procurement","The Swiss approach to defence procurement has a number of distinct features. With modest levels of defence-related R&D, military acquisitions tend to be limited to proven and durable systems offering the user reliable performance over time as well as plenty of scope for future upgrades and adaptations. Long term cost-effectiveness is the key driver of the procurement process with the resultant high ratio of accumulated (military) capital per soldier but a relatively small share of defence in GDP. The Defence Procurement Agency acts as 'the-cradle-to-the-grave' system manager (i.e. it manages both the acquisition process and subsequent through-life support and final disposal). There is a strong commitment to domestic industry with high levels of local content in procurement (in part as a result of offsets) and support for exports. There is also a commitment to a mix of private and public ownership with the latter increasingly exposed to commercial business practices and standards. Most contracts are fixed price with an agreed 'fair' rate of return on capital invested by contractors subject to cost, performance and profitability audits. 'Managed competition' combines a high degree of openness to international trade in key sectors of the economy with protected market niches.","Defence and Peace Economics","99-118","1-2","9","1998","Procurement, Defence-related industry, Defence technology, Competition, Contracting, Offsets, Systems management,","10.1080/10430719808404896","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719808404896","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:9:y:1998:i:1-2:p:99-118",NA,NA

This approach is misleading for two reasons. First, peace and democracy are part of a simultaneous system of relations in which they foster each other. Before quantitative inferences which affect policy conclusions can be reached, a separate structural equation has to be estimated corresponding to each of these variables. The equations must be distinguishable from one another at the same time as they embody the interdependence between peace and democracy. Second, previous regression studies emphasized the statistical association between democracy and peace rather than focusing on the substantive magnitude of that effect. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these concerns, we accepted the data and indexes of one of the most influential statements of the peace-democracy thesis, and studied the Cold War period where it is deemed strongest. We differed from the prevailing paradigm by estimating an identified, simultaneous two-equation interactive system. In this more properly specified model, the dyadic democracy-peace nexus generally was not statistically significant and, more important, was very small in its impact. The alternative, peace causing democracy, was much stronger. Neither equation in the simultaneous system explained more than six per cent of the variance, so that other factors are likely to be much more important. Deterrence of aggression and patient negotiation of differences may be a more important guide to public policy than attempts to export western, democratic institutions to other nations. The analysis of these data show that it is more likely that the most important differences that arise between nations are specific to historic epochs and their political and socio-economic conjunctures. Various other indices have been suggested for conflict and democracy in the literature, as well as numerous modifications of the additional variables to be included in the regression equations. The results have tended to be variable with respect to these modifications, but the failure of single equation model specifications to deal with the problem of simultaneous causation makes their results subject to our fundamental methodological criticism and unable to support the burden of policy recommendations.","Defence and Peace Economics","1-37","1","10","1999","Democracy, Peace, Empirical tests,","10.1080/10430719908404914","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719908404914","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:10:y:1999:i:1:p:1-37",NA,NA

Just as in general equilibrium theory, increasing returns to scale in an arms race leads to very different results than constant or decreasing returns to scale. As one implication, increasing returns can lead to multiple stable equilibria, which can be ranked such that both parties are better off at a lower equilibrium. In this case, both parties could be made better off through arms control agreements that lead to a lower equilibrium. Another implication is that increasing returns can create the possibility of specialization and trade in weapons between the participants in an arms race. Yet another implication is that a third nation may sell weapons to both sides in a conflict. Overall, both the behavior of the participants in an arms race and the implied research agenda are very different for the alternative paradigm of an increasing returns to scale technology in arms production, as compared to the dominant paradigm, the Richardson model of the arms race. The latter assumes a constant or diminishing returns to scale technology, but it cannot account for some modern arms race phenomena.

Second, there is an interaction with local government expenditure decisions in a federal state structure such as the Indian one, in particular through changes in the transfer of income from the central government to local governments. Third, all these fiscal decisions have an impact on growth through the accumulation of human capital and through infrastructure building.

The security aspect is also discussed in the light of ethnic conflict. Small states like Sri Lanka need new and multi-dimensional approaches to old practices especially when a country's very survival is at stake. Lacking a militarily adequate physical size and an ability for flexible defense, a small state has to rely on strategic insights, skills and tactics to outwit the aggressor. Above all, a well-defined strategy for national security should receive the highest priority in the nation's political agenda. The choices before a small state confronted by a powerful regional power, seeking to fill a vacuum left by a colonial hegemon, are limited and intrinsically unpalatable. Small states like Sri Lanka will need to keep their diplomatic options open as to wide a range of influences as possible without committing themselves to any single course of action. What is required is not a systematic linkage, but a partial one. Regional groupings are, by and large, the least disadvantageous, if not most desirable, for small states. Despite the massive disorientation in India's foreign policy stemming from the winding down of Cold War tensions, and the fading away of her links with the former Soviet Union with the latter's dissolution, links which had been the pivot of India's foreign and defense policies since the late 1960s - all of India's neighbors in South Asia will continue to face the common problem of a relationship in which every possible calculation is weighted in favor of India and against her smaller neighbors.","Defence and Peace Economics","361-381","4","10","1999","Sri Lanka, Security Problems,","10.1080/10430719908404933","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719908404933","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:10:y:1999:i:4:p:361-381",NA,NA

After 1975 in particular, military industrialisation in South Africa placed a disproportionately high burden on the country's industrial resources and natural economic and technical capabilities. However, although this suggests that the opportunity cost of domestic arms production has been fairly high, the country's poor economic and development performance since the mid-1970s is a function of underlying structural deficiencies and institutional constraints rather than the consequence of inordinately high defence spending levels.","Defence and Peace Economics","149-172","1","11","2000","South African economy, Defence spending in South Africa, Conscription, South African defence industry, Military industrialisation, Arms production capacity, Disarmament and employment,","10.1080/10430710008404944","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430710008404944","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:11:y:2000:i:1:p:149-172",NA,NA

They claim to develop a simultaneous system of two equations showing that peace and democracy foster each other, and that the effect of peace in encouraging democracy is stronger than that of democracy on peace. Their analysis, however, is flawed. Their research design employs measures of dispute and joint democracy that are inferior to those now common in the literature, and their equation for predicting peace is not properly specified. These problems distort their results. Even so, their results provide evidence of the pacific benefits of democracy. Analyses we conduct with a more completely specified model reveal stronger support for the democratic &#x201c; peace. Furthermore, a test of the effect of interstate conflict on democracy should be done at the national (or monadic) level of analysis; but James et al. perform a dyadic analysis. In a monadic test using vector autoregression, we find that disputes make no contribution to explaining the character of regimes.

The first suggested that when certain prerequisites were fulfilled, arms control agreements served to promote lasting reduction in military spending. The second asserted that instead of promoting savings, arms control encouraged diversion of resources to more advanced and expensive weapons, thus driving defense spending higher. Through the examination of the impact of the Washington Naval Agreements on naval expenditure during the 1920s, this paper provides empirical evidence to support the latter of these competing hypotheses. The United States, Great Britain, and Japan all realized economic savings after signing the Washington Naval Agreements. However, these savings soon eroded as the powers developed more advanced weapons-systems.","Defence and Peace Economics","127-148","1","11","2000","Arms control, Defense expenditures, Arms race,","10.1080/10430710008404943","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430710008404943","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:11:y:2000:i:1:p:127-148",NA,NA

This paper seeks to improve understanding of defence equipment costs by defining a hierarchy of defence equipment within which the direct and indirect life cycle costs of defence equipment may be allocated at different levels. Having reviewed the direct and indirect components of the life cycle cost, this paper then shows how different costing studies for different purposes require different approaches to life cycle costing, and that there is no unique life cycle cost which can be assigned to one particular item of defence equipment. There is instead a range oflife cycle costs, each of which is appropriate for a particular study, and it is important that a quoted cost of an item of defence equipment should be used only in the pertinent circumstances.

Double-digit defense spending increases that were common in the 1980s have been replaced by annual increases lower than present inflation rates, resulting in negative real growth in the country's defense budget. Domestic economic problems and consistent government pressures for smaller budgets have further slowed annual growth in total spending and have contributed to lower procurement budgets. As a result, the domestic Japanese defense industry is facing far more constrained conditions from the growth years of a decade before. Government policymakers are examining Japan's regional security environment as well as its alliance with the United States to determine the appropriate course for the country to take in the coming years. The formal security treaty with the United States is likely to remain a major element of government positions, but other aspects of the country's overall security posture are open to debate. Perceptions of a reduced threat environment are fueling additional pressures for defense budget cuts. The domestic defense industry seeks means to assure its survival in domestic defense markets in this constrained environment. Expansion into overseas markets to offset declining domestic markets is an option that currently is constrained by policy restrictions on arms exports. Industry is advocating re-examination of those policies and unlike earlier years, government appears willing to respond positively but cautiously to this lobbying.","Defence and Peace Economics","369-401","2","11","2000","Japan, Security policy, Defense industry, Kokusanka, FSX/F-2, Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), Defense procurement, Budgets, U.S. Security Treaty, Defense technology cooperation,","10.1080/10430710008404955","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430710008404955","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:11:y:2000:i:2:p:369-401",NA,NA

After some background analysis of the economy and military expenditure, the paper investigates the determinants of Greek military expenditure as well as whether the high military burden has played an important role in Greece's poor economic performance over the period 1960-1996. It estimates a Keynesian simultaneous equation model with a supply side, which allows the indirect effects of military expenditure to be captured explicitly. It concludes that the major determinants of Greek defence spending are not economic but strategic (the threat of war) and that the direct effect of defence spending on economic growth as well as the indirect effects through savings and trade balance are all significantly negative. On the basis of such strong results, the paper concludes that defence spending is harmful for the Greek economy.","Defence and Peace Economics","47-67","1","12","2001","Greece, Military expenditure, Economic effects,","10.1080/10430710108404976","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430710108404976","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:12:y:2001:i:1:p:47-67",NA,NA

The most notable one is military spending. It suggests that in the nineteenth century when Britain was on the rise and strong, its military spending did not appear to hinder its economic performance.

In this context, increased reliability on allies may lead one country to lower defence expenditures and supply.

Paradoxically, almost all previous econometric models suggest that the largely defense-oriented federal industrial R&D funding that helped create these technologies had no discernible effect on U.S. industrial productivity growth. This paper addresses this paradox by stressing that defense procurement as well as federal R&D expenditures were targeted to a few narrowly defined manufacturing sub-sectors that produced high tech weaponry. Analysis employing data from the NBER Manufacturing Productivity Database and the BEA' s Input Output tables then demonstrates that defense procurement policies did have significant effects on the productivity performance of disaggregated manufacturing industries because of a process of procurement-driven technological change.","Defence and Peace Economics","537-568","6","12","2001","Productivity, R&D, Procurement, Manufacturing, United States, Technological Change,","10.1080/10430710108405002","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430710108405002","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:12:y:2001:i:6:p:537-568",NA,NA

Evolutionary stable strategy equilibria are derived and the replicator dynamics are examined for simple two-by-two symmetric games. Not only are positive defense allocations necessary for trade, implying that all trade is of a contested nature, but the defense technology must also exhibit sufficient effectiveness relative to the plunder technology. A continuum of possible exchanges is proposed that is based on the effectiveness of enforcing property claims. For high levels of transactions costs, plunder dominates. As transactions costs decline, mutual trade emerges as one possible exchange mechanism. All market exchange entails some cost of enforcement; it is contested. Insufficient enforcement of property claims produces mutual plunder as the dominant exchange mechanism. Some implications are suggested for institutional evolution.

This procedure can be applied regardless of the stationary properties of the variables in the sample and allows for inferences on long-run estimates, which is not possible under alternative cointegration procedures.

Development economists, peace and defense economists and political economists have extensively investigated the existence of a trade-off between military, education and health spending since the 1970s. However, the literature review reveals that it is hard to establish a general theory of budgetary trade-off between military, education and health spending and make this applicable for all cases. This is mostly due to economic, social, political, and historical differences among the countries Moreover, it is likely that different research techniques, different time periods analyzed may produce different results. As a result of this, researchers have found a variety of outcomes regarding the trade-off between defense-education and health expenditures. This study presents a brief literature review within the framework of trade-offs between defense-education and health expenditures and also concentrates on theoretical model development.

However, in the period 1976-85 the effectiveness of priority protection diminished and defence institutions experienced more of the problems typical of the shortage economic system. The heavy defence burden also created growing difficulties for the civilian economy. The attempts by the Gorbachev government to reform the defence sector and improve defence-economic relationships during perestroika (1985-91) uniformly failed. For most of the transition period, the Russian military-industrial complex has been adversely affected by its low priority status, cuts in defence spending, instability of the hybrid politico-economic system, and negative growth of the economy. The armed forces and defence industry have been reduced in size and their outputs of military services and equipment have fallen to low levels. Nevertheless, the Russian armed forces still have over one million troops, significant stocks of sophisticated conventional weapons, and a large nuclear arsenal. The government of President Putin has raised the priority of the defence sector, increased real defence spending, and adopted ambitious plans to revive Russian military power. It is likely, though, that tight resource constraints will hamper efforts to reform the armed forces and to upgrade weapons.

To do so we have resorted to evaluating the optimal military expenditure for the two countries, allied in the context of the Integrated Defence Doctrine, which is compatible with the constraints imposed by the resources of their economies. All experiments and scenarios examined lead to the conclusion that the current defence burden of the two allies seems to be driving their economies beyond capacity limits. The fact remains, however, that under the circumstances, a one-sided disarmament policy like the one currently followed by Greece, is a risky choice given that the long-term armament programmes pursued by Turkey, whose role in this arms race has been proven as leading, leave very small room to the Greek and Cypriot sides to reduce their own defence expenditure.","Defence and Peace Economics","329-347","4","13","2002","Optimal Control, Defence Expenditure, Arms Race, Relative Military Security,","10.1080/10242690212360","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690212360","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:13:y:2002:i:4:p:329-347",NA,NA

The catch-up hypothesis claims that poor countries tend to grow faster than rich countries through the international diffusion of knowledge and technology. We test this hypothesis for the Balkan countries and investigate the effect of military expenditure in the region on productivity growth. The aim is to investigate empirically whether productivity growth has been greater in countries with lower military expenditure, in line with theory. The results obtained show that, overall, improvements in technological change co-exist with deteriorating technical efficiency change and that there is a negative correlation between military expenditure and either total productivity growth and technological change, and a positive, but statistically insignificant, relationship with technical efficiency change. We conclude that economic growth is the key to regional development and that too great a diversion of resources to military commitments can lead to overstretch.","Defence and Peace Economics","353-363","5","13","2002","Balkan Countries, Productivity Growth, Military Expenditure,","10.1080/10242690213510","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690213510","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:13:y:2002:i:5:p:353-363",NA,NA

However, the results from these studies have not reached definitive conclusions, and have left a gap in the analysis of the impact of defence R&D expenditure at the economy level. Defence R&D has specific characteristics, which lead to market failures: public good, high risk and uncertainty, national security. Also, defence R&D creates two types of externalities: negative (crowding-out), and positive (spin-off). Crowding-out is the major economic debate about defence R&D. This paper analyses the crowding-out hypothesis by applying three types of models for the UK case: supply, demand, and demand-supply models. From these three models the most reliable is chosen and applied to the individual cases of France, Germany, Japan and USA.

However, despite a considerable amount of research, little evidence has been found in favor of an arms race between the two countries. In the literature, this failure of applied studies has been attributed, among other reasons, to the sensitivity of the results to the underlying model specification, to small sample size, and to measurement issues. This study uses novel, nonlinear, models to investigate the possible relationship between the military expenditures of the two countries. It is assumed that if there are two regimes characterizing the low (or negative) and high-growth military expenditure periods, the growth rates of one country's military expenditure may have distinct effects on the military expenditure regimes of the other country or may contribute to the change from one regime to another. The nonlinear models examined are Smooth Transition Regression models (STRs). Strong evidence of nonlinearity for Greece is found, with asymmetry relating to two distinct regimes through lagged Turkish military expenditure changes.","Defence and Peace Economics","405-416","5","13","2002","Arms Race, Smooth Transition Models, Forecasting, Turkey, Greece,","10.1080/10242690213511","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690213511","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:13:y:2002:i:5:p:405-416",NA,NA

Based on a reduced form approach we consider key elements of military theory as production factors for combat success as an output of a military production function. The paper focuses on the relationship of material and non-material factors to battlefield success, and especially on the role of superior force strengths. Contrary to the emphasis on technology which can be found in the recent literature, our estimation results indicate that numerical superiority has retained its crucial role for battlefield performance throughout history. In general, human elements of warfare, like leadership, morale and surprise, have continued to be important determinants of battle outcome despite technological progress in weapons.","Defence and Peace Economics","175-192","3","14","2003","Battlefield Success, Numerical Superiority, Leadership, Technical Progress, Military Technology, Military Production Function,","10.1080/1024269022000000868","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1024269022000000868","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:14:y:2003:i:3:p:175-192",NA,NA

An alternative structure that would cause customers to face the costs their decisions impose upon the support system is recommended.","Defence and Peace Economics","59-69","1","15","2004",NA,"10.1080/1024269042000164496","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/1024269042000164496","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:15:y:2004:i:1:p:59-69","2",NA

The fiscal and economic effects of these various forms of arms transfer financing differ. Data on the flow of arms transfers, as provided by international sources on the arms transfers tell little about actual economic burdens. During the Cold War, military aid and credit financing had larger shares in overall funding of arms imports, particularly by developing countries. After the end of the Cold War, levels of military aid are sharply reduced. Little is known about credit funding. However, measured by an opportunity cost method, it seems that indebtedness due to arms imports did not increase as much during the 1990s as it had during the 1980s. This is another indicator that the arms trade has become more commercial, with customers needing to be able to pay for the imports. Less financially well-off customers have become less important for the producers of new weaponry, and instead import old weapons, or small arms. The differentiation according to financial criteria among customers in the military market increased in the 1990s.","Defence and Peace Economics","111-123","2","15","2004",NA,"10.1080/1024269032000110496","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/1024269032000110496","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:15:y:2004:i:2:p:111-123","4",NA

The former consist of positive externalities of defence activities on the other sectors of the economy, while the latter can be described as crowding-out of civilian investment. Estimations find the supply-side effects to be insignificantly different from zero, while the crowding-out effect of defence spending is significant and substantial. It is thereby established that defence expenditure has a negative overall effect on economic growth in Peru. Although several caveats - including specification problems of the Deger model, the quality of the data used, a relatively small sample and the presence of autocorrelation in the estimations - must be considered, these results turn out to be quite robust with respect to estimation methods (3SLS, 2SLS, OLS) and slight modifications to the model.

US economic and military aid, 1946-1996","If the US has wielded power as global hegemon, then there should be evidence of a linkage between American resources and the ability to influence behavior. However, there is widespread disagreement on how this power is manifested (see Krause, 1991). Methodological and epistemological issues have hampered empirical studies of US hegemonic behavior. For example, does the US reward past behavior or does it offer inducements for future behavior? We document and discuss these issues in terms of the aid-foreign policy compliance nexus. The empirical portion of our paper tests whether US military and non-military aid are correlated with foreign policy similarity. The main merits of our study are that: (1) we test a new measure of foreign policy similarity developed by Signorino and Ritter (1999) and compiled by Gartzke et al. (1999); (2) we relax the causality issue and test using vector autoregression (VAR) for 76 developing countries; and (3) our time horizon is a minimum of 30 years for each country. Our central finding is that aid is most often used as a reward. More specifically, foreign policy similarity leads to greater economic aid for most African countries, foreign policy similarity leads to greater military aid for a majority of Latin American states, and there are no overarching patterns for Asia and the Middle East.

This form of cooperation, known as the 'Integrated Defence Space Doctrine', aims at defending their interests in the Aegean Sea and the broader East Mediterranean theatre. The paper relies heavily on earlier research on this topic, which deals with the Greek-Cypriot alliance facing an arms race against Turkey, and uses a coefficient especially designed to assess the optimal levels of security and the associated defence expenditure of the two allies. A comparison of the relative security coefficient values for the two allies suggests that the security benefit that Greece derives thanks to its alliance with Cyprus exceeds the corresponding Cypriot benefit by far. Given the importance assigned to human resources by this index, in conjunction with the demographic problems of Greece, this conclusion justifies the recent Greek defence policy revision, emphasizing quality, capital equipment and flexibility of forces.

The UK, with more modest defence ambitions, capabilities and budget, will seek to keep in touch with the US. However, a commercially-led drive to embed UK industry even more deeply in the US defence market could be the last step in creating a largely US-UK North Atlantic relationship, with much of Europe very much a subsidiary business concern.

Minimum force element levels (thresholds), and scale economies facilitate specialization as opposed to scope economies (e.g. platform-sharing), scale diseconomies and the force scope multiplier (e.g. defence weakest-link technology). When a balanced force is not optimal, the option value of a non-optimally maintained force element must also include the opportunity cost arising from suboptimal force elements. Shrinking defence budgets may produce two surprising phenomena.

In spite of Ottawa's desire to promote international peace and stability alongside the United States and the United Nations, Canada's minimalist approaches to defence spending and capital expenditures are undermining the long-term viability of the Canadian Forces' (CF) expeditionary and interoperable capabilities. Two solutions to this dilemma present themselves: increased defence spending or greater force structure specialization. Since Ottawa is unlikely to increase defence spending, specialization provides the only practical solution to the CF's capabilities predicament. Although it would limit the number of tasks that the CF could perform overseas, specialization would maximize the output of current capital expenditures and preserve the CF's interoperability with the US military in an age of defence transformation.

But does the country still have the means of its ambitions? The analysis of statistical data since 1990 may show that the independent policy of security has been clearly replaced by a real dependency on armaments and strategies, in the context of higher budgetary constraints. Military expenditures now seem to be more an economic burden than a driving force. The study of the defence budget compared with the general state budget shows that military expenditures are often used as variables of economic adjustment and that inertia effects are important. Several aspects of the French defence policy are underlined, notably the weakness of French military research and development, the declining share of capital expenditures in the defence budget and the decreasing investment in the nuclear field. In addition, the French arms industry suffers from a too-belated restructuring and from the continuing compartimentalization of European markets.","Defence and Peace Economics","297-315","4","16","2005","French defence policy, Defence budget, Defence industrial base, Structure of military expenditures,","10.1080/10242690500115915","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690500115915","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:16:y:2005:i:4:p:297-315",NA,NA

In this context, one topical issue is how to motivate defence firms to apply for private rather than public finance. Since banks have no prior experience with European defence firms, a problem of asymmetric information may block this transition. The problem is analysed within the framework of a game between defence firms and banks. It is shown that the Bayesian Equilibrium might correspond to a situation where low-risk firms prefer the state-financed scheme; yet, in a perfect information set-up, the same firms would apply for bank credit. In order to facilitate the transition to private finance, the government might decide to subsidize investors who agree on financing defence firms; the state aid should be made available during a transitory learning period.","Defence and Peace Economics","23-36","1","17","2006","European defence firms, Private finance, Bayesian Equilibrium, Asymmetric information,","10.1080/10242690500216580","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690500216580","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:17:y:2006:i:1:p:23-36",NA,NA

Specifically, high-risk aversion and low risk are shown to favor domestic production support as the better defense, and to disfavor stockpiling (and vice versa).

The first pillar expands on Eckstein and Tsiddon (2004) to account explicitly for a subjective assessment of the probability of death due to an act of terror; the second explicitly accounts for the dissatisfaction that derives from untimely death. In the first pillar, individuals estimate the risk of death by invoking the cumulative-prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1992). Since the probability of death in a terrorist attack is low, decision weights are higher than the actual probabilities. Needless to say, while cumulative-prospect theory governs individuals' behavior, the economy is governed by actual probabilities. The second pillar on which our explanation rests is the disutility that emerges from an individual's untimely and unnatural death.

It examines the long-run causal relationship using the weak exogeneity test and utilizes general impulse response functions to determine whether a shock to defence expenditures affects economic growth or vice versa. Our findings provide substantive evidence in favour of the existence of a long-run equilibrium cointegrated relationship between defence expenditures, GDP, labour and capital stock. The results of the weak exogeneity test indicate that a bi-directional causal relationship exists in the long-run between defence expenditures and GDP. Thus, the main policy implication that emerges from the long-run results is that increasing defence expenditures in Taiwan is an effective means to boost overall economic performance and, with this improved economy, it should then be able to increase its defence expenditures further. Lastly, from our dynamic vector error correction model estimations, it is found that defence expenditures are a major means of adjusting for disequilibria that occur within the system.","Defence and Peace Economics","361-385","4","17","2006","Defence expenditures, Economic growth, Taiwan, Capital stock, Cointegration,","10.1080/10242690600612738","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690600612738","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:17:y:2006:i:4:p:361-385",NA,NA

This paper analyzes the economic costs and benefits of recent options from a global resource point of view. It is concluded that standby forces provided by Member States to the UN, such as the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade for UN Operations (SHIRBRIG) and the more recent European Union (EU) Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), appear presently to be economically the most efficient means of providing UN peacekeeping. Standby forces, acknowledged by the UN as a feasible alternative to a UN standing army or police force, are economically the most efficient basically because they utilize more fully the existing military resources of Member States, rather than require major additional new resources for peacekeeping.","Defence and Peace Economics","413-419","5","17","2006","Peacekeeping, Standing army, Standby arrangement, United Nations,","10.1080/10242690600888197","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690600888197","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:17:y:2006:i:5:p:413-419",NA,NA

The key to an effective operation is to select peace support personnel with the skills appropriate to that particular mission. This paper is divided into three sections, starting with a discussion of the supply and demand for military personnel.

This multi-state optimization theme recurs in a wide variety of economic contexts, ranging across taxation and income distribution, international trade and market disruption, labor contracts and unemployment insurance, Rawlsian design of social contracts, provision for retirement, and many others. Because analyses of such topics are frequently so context driven, the generality of this theme seems to have gone unnoticed and, of a particular paradoxical result, unappreciated. One example of this paradox is how lump-sum distribution in a first best environment will reverse the preference rankings of the endowed distribution of utilities - after redistribution the originally 'bad' outcomes become preferred to originally better ones. Or as another example, if fair insurance is available, the rational resource owner will buy so much insurance that the otherwise 'bad' contingency becomes preferred.

The purpose is to measure the opportunity costs of defense spending mainly in terms of alternative public programs. The correlation of social sector expenditures with growth rate as well as the extent of correlation between social and defense sector spending is not clear in the majority of developing countries. It follows that even if defense spending is reduced, the prospects for a peace dividend in the aftermath of the Cold War might be inhibited by political interests that oppose increases in social sector expenditures. If so, defense cutbacks might not lead to a welfare windfall as is generally presumed. Accordingly, this paper tests whether a defense spending cutback will enhance funding for other public programs and whether such a reallocation of resources will prove to be beneficial for the long-term growth rate of the economy.","Defence and Peace Economics","39-52","1","18","2007","Peace dividend, Military Expenditures, Growth,","10.1080/10242690600924620","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690600924620","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:18:y:2007:i:1:p:39-52",NA,NA

Using up-to-date data for 27 OECD countries and 62 non-OECD countries for the 1988-2003 period, we combine cross-sectional and time series data to re-investigate the relationship between GDP and ME. Previous studies using time series data may have yielded misleading results on account of the short time span of typical datasets. By contrast, we use recently developed panel unit root tests and heterogeneous panel cointegration tests, and conclude that there is fairly strong evidence in favour of the hypothesis of a long-run equilibrium relationship between GDP and ME. The long-run panel regression parameter results, such as the fully modified OLS, indicate that a positive relationship between GDP and ME only holds for OECD countries, whereas a negative relationship from ME to GDP only exists in non-OECD countries under examination and in the panel as a whole. Furthermore, by implementing the dynamic panel-based error correction model, we determine that GDP and ME lack short-run causalities, but do show long-run bidirectional causalities in both OECD and non-OECD countries.","Defence and Peace Economics","265-280","3","18","2007","Defence expenditure, GDP, Panel cointegration, Causality relationship,","10.1080/10242690500452706","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690500452706","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:18:y:2007:i:3:p:265-280",NA,NA

This paper investigates this non-linear interaction in the context of the Solow and Barro growth models recommended by Dunne et al.1 (2005). Using fixed effects, random effects, and Arellano-Bond GMM estimators, I examine the growth effects of military expenditure, arms trade, and their interaction in a balanced panel of 28 countries during 1965-2000. The augmented Solow growth model specified in Dunne et al. (2005) yields more robust estimates than the reformulated Barro model.

This is an especially important result since one of the main characteristics of globalization has been the reduction of barriers to international capital flows and, as a consequence, the amounts of capital flows have expanded enormously dwarfing those of trade flows.

Functional form is investigator-specified, and all methods assume that the data generation process across all segments of the examined time-series is constant. In contrast, the aim of heuristic methods is to automate the discovery of functional form and permit different segments of a time-series to stem from different underlying data generation processes. These methods are categorized into those based on neural networks (NN) and those based on evolutionary computation, the latter further divided into genetic algorithms (GA), evolutionary programming (EP), and genetic programming (GP). However, the duration of the time-series itself is still investigator determined. This paper uses a dynamic forecasting version of GP (DFGP), where even the length of the time-series is automatically discovered. The method is applied to an examination of US GDP that includes military expenditure among its determinants and is compared to a regression-based forecast.

Allowing defence expenditure to have a non-linear effect sheds considerable new light on the characteristics of the defence-growth link. The single subject, Taiwan, is tested using both a neoclassical one-sector aggregate production function model and Feder's (1982) two-sector production function model over the 1960 to 2002 period. The empirical analysis indicates that the threshold effect strongly exists in 1973 and 1982 coinciding with the occurrence of two energy crises, and the non-linear relationship is solidly supported with both models.

The modeling strategy follows the Sandler and Hartley (1995) and Dunne et al.

We thus combine the public capital version of endogenous growth with a framework of competitive arms accumulation.

However, the present article argues that the US strategy can be viewed as a rational approach to combating transnational terrorist attacks on the American homeland. By deploying a large, activist contingent of troops in a geographical location relatively close to the terrorists' base of operations, a target country can, under certain specified circumstances, successfully deflect terrorist attacks away from domestic civilians, even if the effect of such deployment is not directly to diminish the terrorists' capacity to launch attacks. The interaction between the target government and a terrorist organization is characterized as a sequential move game, the solution to which identifies the conditions under which a deflection strategy maximizes the expected payoff to the target government. It is shown that the deflection strategy makes most sense when the perceived cost of a terrorist attack on the homeland is high and when the target nation is militarily strong and confident of success, has a relatively small proportion of its domestic population that is sympathetic to the terrorists' cause, and is geographically distant from the main base of terrorist operations. Target countries for which one or more of these conditions are absent might be expected to rationally reject such a strategy.","Defence and Peace Economics","1-20","1","19","2008","Terrorism, Deterrence, Iraq, Game Theory,","10.1080/10242690701453685","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690701453685","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:19:y:2008:i:1:p:1-20",NA,NA

Such social conflict may also be transformed into armed conflict. Others argue that globalization promotes economic growth and reduces poverty, which leads to a reduction in the risk of internal conflict. Several studies find trade to reduce the risk of interstate conflict. This article investigates the impact of trade and trade shocks on the risk of intrastate conflict. A set of operationalizations of economic shock is developed and used to analyze the risk of conflicts that involve at least 25 battle deaths per year. The analysis finds no robust evidence for a direct relationship between trade openness, trade shocks, and the risk of armed conflict. There is somewhat more basis for concluding that globalization affects the risk indirectly through its effect on long- and short-term growth.

The study finds that the deficit as a percentage of GNP has a negative and significant impact on transfer payments as a percentage of GNP. The IRFs indicate that shocks to deficit expenditures as a percentage of GNP (DEFGNP) have statistically significant impacts on defence spending as a percentage of GNP (DSGNP), educational expenditures as a percentage of GNP (EDGNP), health expenditures as a percentage of GNP (HEGNP), and transfer payments as a percentage of GNP (TPGNP). The results derived from this study also indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between defence spending as a percentage of GNP and deficits as a percentage of GNP. Therefore, defence spending is viewed as a tool for transferring income among different social-income groups and across generations in Turkey for the period 1965-2004.

Each agent allocates resources to defend its production and attack the production of the other agent. Production, conflict and exchange occur simultaneously in a dynamic model. This extends earlier exchange models, which are static and preclude defense and appropriation. The agents jointly determine price through their export decisions. Upon introducing exchange endogenously, raiding in the first relative to the second period decreases with growth, appropriation cost, and when the future becomes more important, and increases with defense cost, production cost, and usability of appropriation. Increasing the usability of appropriation and defense cost causes a transition from pure exchange via joint exchange and raiding to pure raiding. This implies that agents gradually substitute from defense to appropriation, they exchange less, and utility decreases. Utility isoquants in a usability of appropriation versus discount factor diagram are concavely increasing for joint exchange and raiding, and can be convexly decreasing for pure raiding. Cobb-Douglas utilities are assumed.

The empirical finding of impulse response functions of defence expenditures to a shock in the partisan effect is positive. The results reported here indicate that political colours of parties appear to be important. This suggests that defence expenditure is influenced by political ideology and the fiscal policy of governments after elections. Moreover, the impulse response functions of external debt stock to shocks to the electoral effects and the response of external debt stock shocks to the partisan effects increased over the whole period.","Defence and Peace Economics","217-224","3","19","2008","External debt, Defence expenditures, Business cycles, Turkey,","10.1080/10242690801972170","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690801972170","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:19:y:2008:i:3:p:217-224",NA,NA

The article also aims at making a contribution towards a better understanding of some economic conditions that are related to terrorism. For this purpose, a novel approach to the examination of the roots of terrorism has been followed. First, we run Principal Components Analysis on total GDP and its components in South Eastern Turkey in order to reduce the number of potential explanatory variables. Second, we use the first three components in a logit regression where the dependent variable consists of an index of terrorist attacks. The results of the analysis have revealed that total GDP is helpful in explaining terrorism in Turkey. Furthermore, we find evidence that agriculture and government services are more important components of GDP in explaining terrorism than factors such as trade, construction, manufacturing and transportation.","Defence and Peace Economics","225-233","3","19","2008","Terrorism, Defence expenditure, Turkey,","10.1080/10242690801972196","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690801972196","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:19:y:2008:i:3:p:225-233",NA,NA

This paper, assuming that the provision of common European defence to the participating members has the characteristics of a pure public good, approaches the burden sharing issue raised by Hartley (2003) by calculating a simple benefit share index that is then compared with the contribution made by each country to the costs of the common defence.

The situation is not the same as far as the demand for military expenditure is concerned, where less attention has been given and the majority of empirical studies have focused on individual countries, with only a few focusing on groups of countries and employing cross-sectional or panel data approaches. A region that has not attracted any research interest regarding the determinants of military expenditure is the European Union (EU) with the exception of individual country studies (mainly for the UK, Greece, France, Spain, Portugal). This paper argues that understanding the determinants of military spending in these countries is very important, especially given the discussions in recent years towards the development of a Common European Security and Defence Policy (CESDP). It then follows Dunne et al. (2003) and employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration to estimate a general model of aggregate defence spending for each of the 15 core EU countries over the period 1961-2005. The findings indicate that there is very little uniformity in the factors that determine each country's demand for military expenditure, something that needs to be borne in mind by policy makers when burden-sharing issues are considered in the development of the CESDP.","Defence and Peace Economics","273-292","4","19","2008","Military expenditure, Demand, European Union, Autoregressive Distributed, Lag (ARDL),","10.1080/10242690802166533","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690802166533","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:19:y:2008:i:4:p:273-292",NA,NA

It extends the Kagan et al.

The model is used to predict the optimal mix of weapons of the two countries engaged in the arms race, and to evaluate the applicability of international strategic WMD limitation agreements. Applying the model to the arms race between Israel and Syria shows that if considered from a purely monetary perspective, such an agreement, in which the monetary transfer to Syria is made by either Israel or a third party, is within reach. A strategic agreement to limit North Korea's WMD is also economically feasible, but only when the monetary transfer to North Korea is shouldered by a third party such as the USA or a coalition of neighboring countries.","Defence and Peace Economics","95-121","2","20","2009","Asymmetric arms race, Weapons of mass destruction (WMD), Arms limitation agreements,","10.1080/10242690801923132","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690801923132","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:20:y:2009:i:2:p:95-121",NA,NA

Naval manpower planners need to consider appropriate measures to improve retention in the service. The evidence gathered from the empirical investigation shows that external (pull) factors exert a significant effect on the early exit/quit rates from the RN. Key economic factors such as pay and employment opportunities in the civilian employment markets play an important role in the decisions that individual ratings make with regard to remaining in naval employment or leaving altogether. In particular, it was found that quit rates from the Navy are negatively associated with the claimant count (unemployment) rate (i.e. as the unemployment rate in the civilian economy increases, the early exit rate from the Navy decreases), whilst the overall increase in civilian wages bears a positive relationship on quitting behaviour. The analysis provides further evidence to support the need for policies that are tailor-made to cater for different ratings' specialisations within the Royal Navy.","Defence and Peace Economics","233-251","3","20","2009","Retention, Early exits, Hazard function, Royal Navy,","10.1080/10242690802001904","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690802001904","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:20:y:2009:i:3:p:233-251",NA,NA

We also find conditions in which a third party optimally intervenes but at a level insufficient to deter rebellion. Such behavior, which improves the incumbent government's potential to succeed in conflict, is overlooked in some conflict studies evaluating the effectiveness of intervention.

Whilst there can be good reasons for single sourcing, the opportunities and inducements for corruption are significantly escalated. Further, some countries that claim to employ single-source only in rare instances are found to have high percentages of non-competitive defence procurement.

While parametric partial correlations are in line with empirical findings, the robustness of estimations is tested by using a non-parametric approach.

In theory, human capital may increase the opportunity cost of military service and the economic cost of injury and loss of life in combat; it may decrease the benefits of conflict as human capital cannot be easily appropriated or transferred; it may affect societal norms toward peace and war; and it may alter military productivity through new technology and complementarities between military technology and personnel. Using a panel of politically relevant dyads, I find robust empirical evidence that human capital may significantly decrease the likelihood of militarized conflict between nations. In short, the findings suggest that promoting human capital-oriented development may help to increase peace in the world.","Defence and Peace Economics","395-411","5","20","2009",NA,"10.1080/10242690802682109","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242690802682109","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:20:y:2009:i:5:p:395-411","10",NA

EXPLAINING PATTERNS OF SWISS DEFENSE SPENDING IN 1975-2001","We study the behavior of defense spending in Switzerland over 1975-2001. Our main interest is in determining how neutrality in international affairs (non-membership in military alliances) affects defense spending. We find that neutrality is associated with a perception of lower levels of external threat; hence it confers economic benefits in the form of a smaller defense burden. However, neutrality does not fully insulate a country from variations in the level of external threat in the global system as perceived by members of military alliances. Swiss defense spending has tracked very closely the spending trends - but at a lower average level - of the United States and other NATO countries. To the extent that post-Cold War threats, such as international terrorism, materialize primarily in the context of existing security alliances, Swiss military spending patterns observed in 1975-2001 are likely to remain the same in the future.","Defence and Peace Economics","413-422","5","20","2009",NA,"10.1080/10242690802051537","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242690802051537","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:20:y:2009:i:5:p:413-422","10",NA

The paper demonstrates that there are information gains to this approach. The well-known conflict database of the International Peace Research Institute is compared with the database of the Center for Systemic Peace, which includes data on the number of deaths in addition to length of conflict. The number and distribution of conflicts vary; however, duration analysis based on the conventional measure of duration yields results that are robust over the above-mentioned datasets. We also show that the number of deaths, as a measure of duration, challenges some of the results based on the number of years as a measure of duration. In the 1990s, the duration of conflicts is significantly different from before when the duration measure is the number of years - we do not find a statistically significant distinction when the number of deaths is used.

Allied with difficulties of matching personnel numbers and posts, significant skill mismatches can take a long time to eradicate, with obvious financial and operational penalties. In the light of these factors, a holistic understanding of the exit behaviour of naval personnel is vital for naval manpower planners. This paper analyses ratings' voluntary (quits) and involuntary (separation) exit patterns from the Royal Navy using an independent competing risks hazard regression analysis framework. The results show that both voluntary and involuntary exits are pro cyclical with respect to macroeconomic and labour market conditions for both male and female ratings. Male ratings are more likely to quit or separate due to a lack of promotion to higher ranks as compared with females. Male ratings are also more likely to quit as a result of a hectic operational tempo when compared with their female counterparts. Frequency of sea/shore deployments also seems to exert a significant effect with respect to quits and separation outcomes of both genders. In terms of marital status married males are less likely to quit compared with their unmarried male counterparts, whereas the opposite is the case for female ratings.","Defence and Peace Economics","207-228","3","21","2010","Retention, Early exits, Competing risks framework, Duration analysis, Royal Navy,","10.1080/10242690903568959","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690903568959","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:21:y:2010:i:3:p:207-228",NA,NA

First, it presents a simple theoretical model of conflict that defines a two-sector economy. In a contested sector, two agents struggle to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In an uncontested sector, they hold secure property rights over the production of some goods. Agents split their resource endowment between 'butter', 'guns' and 'ice-cream'. Following the theoretical insights the empirical analysis focuses on the relationship between civil wars and different sectors of the economy. In particular, a panel probit specification shows that the incidence of a civil war decreases in the size of manufacturing sector.","Defence and Peace Economics","269-283","3","21","2010","Civil war, Resource curse, Butter, guns and ice-cream, Structure of the economy, Panel probit analysis,","10.1080/10242690903568975","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242690903568975","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:21:y:2010:i:3:p:269-283",NA,NA

Schooling and household size, which are respectively much lower and higher among the rural Arab population, also explain significant fractions of income inequality. Location and gender of the household head explain much smaller fractions. Education-enhancing policies directed at the lower end of the schooling distribution, and at Arab municipalities in particular, are recommended to reduce per capita income inequality in rural Israel and narrow the Jewish-Arab gap.

Such a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve is consistent with the existence of adverse effects on most components of aggregate expenditure documented in previous empirical studies. The long-term consequences of terrorism are similar to those related to a negative supply shock. Such a leftward shift of the long-run aggregate supply curve agrees with adverse effects on the determinants of the potential output, such as contractions of physical capital highlighted in earlier work, as well as reductions of technological innovations and slowdowns of net immigrations, which have not been fully analyzed in the existing empirical literature.","Defence and Peace Economics","317-336","4","21","2010","Output, Price, and Terrorist Indices, Structural Vector Autoregressions, Long-run Identifying Restrictions, Dynamic Responses and Variance Decompositions,","10.1080/10242694.2010.491705","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242694.2010.491705","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:21:y:2010:i:4:p:317-336",NA,NA

THE ORIGIN OF DEMOCRATIC PEACE","This paper explores the effects of dyadic democracy on both the occurrence and level of militarized disputes, with an emphasis on longitudinal tendencies and degrees of violence. We argue that experience with total war, namely, the First World War, induced democratic constraints on conflictual foreign policies via significant change in military manpower systems. Experience with total war led democratic governments to recognize each other's sensitivity to public concerns about the burdens imposed by conscription. Thus, democratic peace in the modern era can be traced to (1) total war experience for 'old' democracies; and (2) the level of violence in foreign policies exceeding a threshold that induces public concerns about the burden of conscription. Empirical testing based on the Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) data set shows a significantly different effect for democratic dyads on the onset of militarized disputes before and after the First World War. Democratic dyads, however, do not reduce the likelihood of disputes in cases with a low level of violence regardless of the era in question. This implies that conflict-averse behavior between democracies is a product of learning from the experience of total war that leads to greater government awareness of public concern about more intense foreign policy actions.","Defence and Peace Economics","487-505","5-6","21","2010",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2010.513493","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10242694.2010.513493","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:21:y:2010:i:5-6:p:487-505",NA,NA

We argue that these organizational changes, along with data on important background variables, make it possible to rely on selection on observables.

Such tests answer a specific although quite limited question: can one reject the null hypothesis that one variable does not help predict another? If one can reject, there is said to be Granger causality, GC. Although the limitations of GNC tests are well known, they are often not emphasised in the applied literature and so may be forgotten. This paper considers the econometric and methodological issues involved and illustrates them with data for the US and other countries. There are three main issues. First, the tests may not be informative about the substantive issue, the interaction of military expenditure and the economy, since Granger causality does not correspond to the usual notion of economic causality. To determine the relationship of the two notions of causality requires an identified structural model. Second, the tests are very sensitive to specification. GNC testing is usually done in the context of a vector autoregression, VAR, and the test results are sensitive to the variables and deterministic terms included in the VAR, lag length, sample or observation window used, treatment of integration and cointegration and level of significance. Statistical criteria may not be very informative about these choices.

The 'credibility rationale', argues that hawks may actually be necessary to initiate peace agreements.

The 'social psychological rationale' captures the idea of a competition over which group can form the strongest identity. Dove selection can be predicted during conflict, but hawk selection post-conflict. Finally, the 'expressive rationale' predicts that regardless of the underlying nature of the game the large group nature of decision-making in rendering individual decision makers non-decisive in determining the outcome of elections may cause them to make choices based primarily on emotions.

The time period between the two papers contributes to the reliability of the results derived, not just by increasing the number of observations, but also mainly by incorporating the progress made in the realm of artificial intelligence. The focus on the case of both countries unlike the paper mentioned above that dealt with just the Greek side provides ample room for comparative purposes regarding the determinants of defense expenditure on both sides. The results derived in terms of input significance estimation support the findings of the earlier research as indicated above, pointing to the leading role of the demographic preponderance of Turkey over Greece. The paper also points to the fact that 10 years later, Turkey continues to set the arms race rules against its rival by determining the defense expenditure of Greece, whereas the role of the latter in affecting the military spending of Turkey is non&#x2010;existent.","Defence and Peace Economics","459-469","4","22","2011",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2010.539858","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2010.539858","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:22:y:2011:i:4:p:459-469","11",NA

Evolution in the Conventional Wisdom since 9/11","The basic narrative of bargaining theory predicts that, all else equal, anarchy favors concessions to challengers who demonstrate the will and ability to escalate against defenders. For this reason, post-9/11 political science research explained terrorism as rational strategic behavior for non-state challengers to induce government compliance given their constraints. Over the past decade, however, empirical research has consistently found that neither escalating to terrorism nor with terrorism helps non-state actors to achieve their demands. In fact, escalating to terrorism or with terrorism increases the odds that target countries will dig in their political heels, depriving the non-state challengers of their given preferences.

The technique is applied to two different dynamic models in terrorism: terrorism and tourism, and terrorist innovations. In the first model the number of tourists that appears in an integral term and also in a derivative term is impacted by the number of terrorists. In the second model the integro-differential equation for terrorist innovations relates them to terrorist attacks. The article shows how to solve, analyze, interpret, and deal with integro-differential equations. Integro-differential equations shed light on aspects of the models ignored when other techniques are used.

With the ongoing cross-Strait dialogue and closer commercial ties between Taiwan and China, the share of military spending in government expenditures (or GDP) has tended to gradually decline, which is in accordance with the change in defense policy from an offensive posture to a defensive-oriented attitude. In addition, we investigate the defense spending--inflation nexus in Taiwan. The multivariate structural change test identifies two break points and three regimes are categorized accordingly. The Granger causality test based on the VAR model reveals that the heavy defense burden in Taiwan during 1952--71 (the first regime) is essentially an important factor causing the higher price levels. However, when the tension across the Taiwan Strait is alleviated as well as the defense-oriented policy adopted, the military spending no longer plays a crucial role in determining inflation in the recent two regimes.

Eventually, we focus on the relationship between productivity and military expenditure.

In investigating the defence--external debt nexus, we employ three advanced panel techniques of fully modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) to estimate our model. We observe that military expenditure has a positive and significant impact on external debt in African countries. Real GDP affects the total debt stock of African countries with a negative relationship. Our empirical results based on long-run elasticities show that a 1% rise in national output leads to a decline in external debt by 1.52%, on average. Policy-wise, the study suggests that African countries need to strengthen areas of fiscal responsibility and pursue models that encourage rational spending, particularly reductions in military expenditure.","Defence and Peace Economics","485-506","5","23","2012",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2011.627163","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2011.627163","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:23:y:2012:i:5:p:485-506","10",NA

While extensive research examines the relationship between military expenditure and economic growth, little attention has been paid to the effect of military expenditure on economic inequality. Studying inequality in MENA countries provides an opportunity to assess factors that shape the countries&#x2019; level of economic well-being, which has greater public policy implications in terms of how society allocates its scarce resources among competing needs. This paper examines two important issues. In the first part of the paper, we examine the relationship between military spending and inequality in MENA countries using a panel regression for country-level observations over the period 1987--2005. The empirical results indicate that military spending has a strong and negative effect on inequality. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, in MENA countries a systematic increase in military spending could reduce the level of inequality. In the second part of this paper, we examine the demand for military expenditure; we find that factors such as inequality level and per capita income negatively affect military expenditure.","Defence and Peace Economics","575-589","6","23","2012",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2012.663578","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2012.663578","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:23:y:2012:i:6:p:575-589","12",NA

In contrast to some earlier findings in the conflict literature, we derive conditions under which war dominates settlement as the Nash equilibrium choice in a one-period game without incomplete information or misconceptions. These conditions are shown to depend not only on resources allocated to the production of military weapons, but also on the endogenous destructiveness of weapons used in warfare. We show that contending parties always allocate more resources to arms productions under settlement (in the shadow of conflict) than under war. When total destruction is less than the difference in arms productions between settlement and war, each party&#x2019;s expected payoff is relatively higher under war. As a result, war dominates settlement. But, when total destruction is greater than the difference in arms productions between settlement and war, each party&#x2019;s expected payoff is relatively higher under settlement. In this case, settlement dominates war and the larger scale of destructiveness associated with higher arms levels generates an effective deterrence for &#x2018;armed peace&#x2019;. One implication of the positive analysis is that, under the threat of conflict, arms reductions for promoting peace can never be voluntary.","Defence and Peace Economics","23-46","1","24","2013",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2012.659862","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2012.659862","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:24:y:2013:i:1:p:23-46","2",NA

With this novel approach, the elasticity of substitution, associated with the terrorists' production function, becomes a key determinant of the effectiveness of deterrence. If this elasticity is large, then countermeasures have very limited effectiveness when directed at a single mode of attack. If, in contrast, attack modes are complements, focused countermeasures can completely eliminate terrorists' gains. Counterterrorism measures are more effective when terrorist campaigns display little diversity of attacks.

Studies examining the linkage between defence spending and government debt have been relatively rare. Given the recent Global Financial Crisis, originating in the developed economies, and the changed international security picture since 9/11, it is timely to reconsider the defence-debt nexus in the rich economies. This study pays particular attention to developing an empirical strategy which is both soundly based on economic theory concerning the evolution of public debt and which uses econometric methods that are welladapted to the dynamic aspects of the relationship. From the standpoint of economic theory, if a government seeks to minimize the distortionary costs of taxation, then taxation will follow a random walk. Unexpected shocks (war and recession) will cause debt. Other idiosyncratic national-level political considerations that affect the evolution of debt can be factored out by the use of a dynamic panel estimation method. Employing the Arellano--Bond dynamic panel model to the data available from members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the periods 1988--2009 and 1999--2009, this study finds that the defence burden is a statistically significant and economically important determinant of public debt.","Defence and Peace Economics","133-145","2","24","2013",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2012.673839","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2012.673839","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:24:y:2013:i:2:p:133-145","4",NA

The motivation for this paper was whether it was possible to rationalize the lack of democratic space in Kashmir, relative to other states in India (especially since the founding fathers of the country had announced such democratic practices to be the guiding principles of the new nation) and at the same time, a highly rigid stance of the Indian Government on the Kashmir issue. An otherwise standard political economic model is used to capture how the way in which citizens determine their allegiance to one or the other nation state (India or Pakistan) can, in turn, affect the nation state's (India's) policies towards the contested land. I conclude that if the Indian Government perceives allegiance of the citizens to be determined primarily by partisan preferences of the citizens, not so much by their preferences for policies, then the government rationally concentrates on minimizing its disutility due to deviations from its &#x2018;most-favorite' policy.

We hypothesise that similar to civilian workers, job transition decisions of the RN ratings are dependent upon alternative job availability and macroeconomic conditions. In addition, working conditions, gender and skill mix, family commitments and promotion prospects in the Navy influence their decisions to leave early. We estimate the unemployment elasticity for males to be  - 0.65 (female  - 0.51), which is high, compared to the elasticity reported for the US Navy. The civilian wage is positively related to exit probability from the RN. Overall, married ratings are less likely to exit as compared to their unmarried counterparts, but married female ratings are 88% more likely to leave early as compared to unmarried females in the Navy. Promotion to higher ranks reduces the probability of early exists.","Defence and Peace Economics","339-369","4","24","2013",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2012.695035","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2012.695035","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:24:y:2013:i:4:p:339-369","8",NA

This study analyzes the choice of the R&D projects designed to counter multiple related military threats. It develops the methodology required to assess whether it is preferable to develop one project to thwart several related threats, or several distinct projects, each of which provides an answer to one specific threat or a partial set of the threats. An analytic solution is provided and assessed for two simple models with two related threats. A solution of the model is then provided for any number of related threats, using a dynamic programming methodology.

In our previous article, we evaluated the large-scale Army policies to replace relatively light Type 1 Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (TWVs) with moderately protected Type 2 variants, and later to replace Type 2s with heavily protected Type 3s. We find that the switch from Type 2 to Type 3 TWVs did not appreciably reduce fatalities and were not cost-effective. Mr. Gayl contends that the data and choice of control variables used in our original study negatively bias our findings for Type 3 TWVs. We defend our previous conclusions and argue that Gayl's suggested approach of focusing on <italic>deaths per insurgent attack</italic> fails to account for effects of the vehicles on when, where, and how attacks occurred. Our methodology does not suffer from this bias and measures effects on total unit casualties rather those incurred <italic>per attack</italic>.

This study is the first attempt to quantify the economic cost of the DC. The war's costs include the destruction of infrastructure, direct military spending attributable to the war effort, and the impact of the latter on capital formation. In addition, the human destruction -- loss of life and income -- must be taken into account. Our calculations show that the government of Sudan has incurred costs totaling US$30.5 billion, equivalent to 171% of 2003 Gross Domestic Product GDP, on the war in Darfur. This includes $10.1 billion in direct military expenses; $7.2 billion in the lost productivity of internally displaces persons; $2.6 billion in foregone lifetime earnings of the dead; $4.1 billion in infrastructure damage; and $6.5 billion in war impacts on GDP. The total costs of the war are $41.5 billion if we added military spillover and African Union/UN hybrid operation in Darfur peace-keeping operations of $10.9 billion. While the country has spent only 1.3% of its budget on public health and less than 1% on education over the past two decades.

But with the end of the Cold War, countries' allocative behavior has diverged markedly from OZ's predictions for defense as a homogeneous pure public good voluntarily provided. This paper suggests a replacement for OZ, with the essential difference that 'defense' rather than being aggregated into their single public good is disaggregated into more realistic categories of self-insurance and self-protection. Because allocative behavior in public good groups is essentially driven by income effects, we concentrate on these, which become complex and conflicted, giving much greater scope for goods-inferiority.

These characteristics make it a particularly interesting case study of the determinants of military spending. This paper specifies and estimates an econometric model of the Egyptian demand for military spending, taking into account important strategic and political factors. Both economic and strategic factors are found to play a role in determining military burden/spending, with clear positive effects of lagged military burden, suggesting some sort of institutional inertia, plus negative output and net exports effects. The strategic effect as a result of the impact of Israel's military burden is mostly positive and significant, though its impact is reduced when the impact of important strategic events are taken into account. The military spending of Egypt's allies Jordan and Syria generally seems to have had no effect on Egypt's spending.

Country and individual heterogeneity contribute substantially to the variation of observed risk perception. Singles and individuals with white collar jobs are less likely to mention terrorism as one of the most pressing issues their country faces, while political positioning towards the right makes it more likely to be concerned about terrorism. As far as competing risks are concerned, we find that the likelihood terrorism is mentioned, decreases with spending on pensions as a percentage of GDP being higher. Finally, based on the Bayesian framework, we also examined the formation of terrorism risk perceptions, and decompose the observed country-level time series of terrorism activity into a long- and a short-run component.

We apply our models to the Israeli-Syrian arms race and show that the higher rate of growth of Israel's gross domestic product relative to that of Syria is expected to lead to an increase in Syria's perception of the likelihood of war and to a decrease in Israel's perception of such a likelihood. We also show that if Syria's regime becomes ideologically more extreme, the monetary cost of maintaining Israel's security at the level that it enjoyed prior to the change will be very high, whereas the monetary cost of maintaining Israel's welfare will be moderate.","Defence and Peace Economics","461-480","5","25","2014",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2013.810025","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2013.810025","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:25:y:2014:i:5:p:461-480","10",NA

Thus, using a multiple regression statistical model, we have analyzed the appraisal systems in place in 28 countries to identify factors that influence the development of economic assessment of military expenditure.

A major focus of the paper is to consider the possibility group heterogeneity and non-linearity. Having estimated the model for all of the countries in the panel and finding that military burden has a negative effect on growth in the short and long run, the panel is broken down into various groupings based upon a range of potentially relevant factors, and the robustness of the results is evaluated. The factors considered are different levels of income, conflict experience, natural resources abundance, openness and aid. The estimates for the different groups are remarkably consistent with those for the whole panel, providing strong support for the argument that military spending has adverse effects on growth.

The main finding of this article suggests a positive trade-off between military spending and two types of social welfare expenditures (i.e. education and health spending).

Our results, based on a panel of 104 developing countries during the recent commodity price boom, confirm a negative relationship between resource extraction and sustainable development as measured by ANS. We further look at the specific role of armed conflict and armed violence as captured by the homicide rate. Armed conflict, which is positively associated with resource dependence, negatively affects ANS per capita according to both our OLS and instrumental variables (IV) estimates. Similarly, armed violence has a detrimental effect on sustainable development. Our IV estimate suggests that a one-point increase in the homicide rate decreases ANS per capita by $60. Since education expenditures are a critical ANS component, we further examine the impact of resource dependence and violence on human capital. Consistent with previous findings, resource-dependent countries underinvest in education but armed conflict and violence do not affect the instantaneous share of education expenditures, hinting at a detrimental effect working through physical and social capital rather than education.","Defence and Peace Economics","115-132","1","26","2015",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2013.848580","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2013.848580","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:26:y:2015:i:1:p:115-132","2",NA

The equilibrium growth path can have different phases: submissive equilibrium, tolerant equilibrium, and complete protection equilibrium. Sustainable growth will endogenously induce an adjustment of the defense strategies. As the economy keeps growing, complete protection will eventually be preferred.

This paper attempts to explain the two concepts in a unify theory framework. In the view of conflict economics, a nation's defense spending can be seen as the fighting commitment of distributive effort in the global economy while other is the productive effort. The development of global economy needs the productive efforts from almost every nation, and the distribution of the aggregate output is determined in large degree by the fighting commitment of each nation. The numerical simulation of the model gives a reasonable explanation of the patterns of the divergence/convergence of prosperity-poverty gap between nations, the fact which is evidenced by many empirical analyses. (1) Given the initial wealth ratio between nations fixed, there is a critical value of fighting decisiveness, when the actual value is larger than the critical value, it is more likely to result in Matthew effect; otherwise the gap would gradually be shortened. (2) Given the fighting decisiveness fixed, there is a critical value of initial wealth ratio, when the actual value is larger than the critical value, it is more likely to result in Matthew effect; otherwise, the gap would gradually be shortened.

The cost of the conflict is measured as output forgone relative to what it would have prevailed had Greece followed a post-war recovery similar to that of other nations in Western Europe. A two-stage approach compares Nazi-occupied countries with neutral ones to assess the cost inflicted by Second World War, and then compares Greece with the former to estimate the impact of the civil conflict. A regional analysis finds that the political discontent was mainly shaped by pre-war socio-economic grievances, rather than being affected by contemporaneous deprivation or driven by class structure as hardliners of both sides preferred to present in pushing for an all-out confrontation. The failure to settle political rivalries and thus prevent the conflict is also discussed.","Defence and Peace Economics","383-407","4","26","2015",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2015.1016297","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2015.1016297","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:26:y:2015:i:4:p:383-407","8",NA

We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy, measuring the changes over time in these outcomes following the combat loss of a medic or doctor and comparing it to the changes following the combat loss of a soldier who is not a medic or doctor. We find that overall unit deaths decrease in the five or ten days following the deaths of medical personnel in Vietnam, Korea, and the Pacific theater in World War II (WWII). In contrast, the WWII European and North African results indicate that overall unit deaths rise following medical personnel deaths.

The discussion is inflamed by a speech of the Nationalist Movement Party&#x2019;s leader about the suggestion to announce a SOE ruling after the death of 24 Turkish soldiers in Hakkari (a city in the southeast of Turkey) in an attack of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers&#x2019; Party) on the 19 October 2011. Although a new announcement of SOE did not take place, the discussion itself induced the idea behind this paper which is to provide a quantitative analysis of the SOE in Turkey. In fact, the SOE ruling is not a new concept for Turkey and it has been implemented in 13 cities in the eastern and southeastern regions from 1987 to 2002. Although there have been many discussions about the costs of these 15 years of the SOE ruling in terms of military expenditure and, thus, on the national budget, there is a lack of quantitative analytical examination of the economic and social costs of it. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals negative spillover impacts of the SOE, especially on the forced migration, unemployment, and educational investments. The results also show that SOE ruling is an important factor for the underdevelopment of the eastern and southeastern regions in Turkey and, thus, a new SOE will bring enormous inequalities, both economically and socially, and an intensification of the ethnic tensions in Turkey.","Defence and Peace Economics","117-136","1","27","2016",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2014.891354","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2014.891354","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:27:y:2016:i:1:p:117-136","2",NA

Sweden uses a Defense Price Index (FPI) which is a composite index of different civilan, non-defense, indices to &#x201c;automatically&#x201d; adjust the defense budget for price changes. This should ideally allow decision makers to concentrate on incremental decisions and their economic consequences when deciding on a new defense budget. This approach requires a high precision from FPI in targeting defense inflation. The problems with achieving such a precise index are illustrated in the article. Critical points, in particular, are defining and measuring productivity in defense and price and/or cost escalation of defense equipment. Another complication is that defense, and not only defense equipment, is a &#x201c;tournament good&#x201d; where the most important capability is the relative capability compared mainly with potential opponents in military conflicts and not the absolute capability.

Various explanations proposed by different authors are reviewed. Unit cost growth studies omit corrections for quality changes of equipment, unlike the standard practice in inflation calculation. By bringing the military capability perspective into the discussion of unit cost growth, this article proposes a new approach to equipment unit cost growth, thereby enabling the collective evaluation of quality change with price change. This approach is demonstrated through a case study involving an armoured personnel carrier (APC). Although the price of the APC had increased sixfold with only a minor improvement in transportation capability, the proposed approach shows that the purchasing decisions of its successive generations may have still been cost-effective.

This implies nonlinear convergence path: only when the military expenditure gap between countries reaches the threshold level, will it provide incentives to catch up with rival&#x2019;s military expenditures.

This study explores the extent to which sanctions increase the likelihood of discriminatory government practices against one of the globally most vulnerable groups, ethnic groups. It is argued that sanctions contribute to the rise of official ethnic-based economic and political discrimination through contracting the economy and creating incentives for the target government to employ ethnic-based discriminatory policies. Using data on over 900 ethnic groups from 1950 to 2003, the results lend support for the theoretical claim that sanctions prompt the government to pursue ethnic-based discriminatory economic and political practices in multiethnic countries. The findings also indicate that multilateral sanctions are likely to be more harmful to the well-being of ethnic groups than sanctions levied by individual countries. Further, the negative effect of comprehensive sanctions appears to be greater than that of sanctions with moderate and limited impact on the target economy. The regime type of the target state, on the other hand, appears to have a significant role only in conditioning the hypothesized effect of sanctions on economic discrimination. Overall, this study&#x2019;s focus on a vulnerable segment of the target society -- ethnic groups -- offers a greater understanding of the consequences of sanctions. It also provides additional insight as to how, in multiethnic countries, political elites might domestically respond to external pressures to retain power.","Defence and Peace Economics","480-502","4","27","2016",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2014.920219","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2014.920219","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:27:y:2016:i:4:p:480-502","8",NA

National defense depends on military expenditure and on the strategic environment reflecting a potential hostile external threat. We use aggregate data on consumption, investment, and military spending for the US economy to estimate the parameters of the model. Estimation results suggest that consumption and national defense are complements and that military spending variability is mainly explained by external threat shocks although it also depends on the macroeconomic conditions. We compute impulse response functions of the main macroeconomic variables to several shocks: a total factor productivity shock, a defense technology shock, and a strategic environment shock. Surprisingly, we find that the optimal response to an increase in the external threat (a worsening in the strategic environment) will rise output by reducing consumption and increasing investment.","Defence and Peace Economics","549-570","4","27","2016",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2014.891353","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2014.891353","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:27:y:2016:i:4:p:549-570","8",NA

In this work, we contribute to the literature by evaluating whether the influx of asylum seekers and the increasing presence of armed groups in the bordering provinces of Ecuador have lead to an increase in violence among these provinces. We do not find any link between the arrival of asylum seekers and the incidence of violent crimes in the Ecuadorean bordering provinces.

To address this question, we develop a formal model, where Defender chooses either to police Perpetrators or to make Proxy do so. According to our theory, the delegation of policing can enhance its effectiveness in light of Proxy’s three advantages: (a) Proxy can convince Perpetrators of punishments more credibly than Defender (communicative advantage); (b) Proxy is more likely to identify Perpetrators and detect what they hold dear (informational advantage); (c) Proxy can cripple and punish Perpetrators more effectively (offensive advantage). On the other hand, the delegation may cause inefficiency if Defender has limited information about Proxy’s choice or cost of policing. Depending on the relative size between these advantages and disadvantages, one of the following four forms of policing may emerge: (i) Defender polices Perpetrators on her own (e.g. Somali counter-piracy operations); (ii) Defender induces Proxy to police Perpetrators (U.S. War on Drugs in Colombia and Mexico); (iii) Defender and Proxy together police Perpetrators (Operation Inherent Resolve); (iv) two or more Defender-Proxy states police Perpetrators in each’s own domain (Interpol, Budapest Convention).","Defence and Peace Economics","349-366","3","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1331081","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1331081","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:3:p:349-366","4",NA

It specifically takes into account the possibility of alleged ‘nexus’ between the government and the industry and explores its implications on the level of allocation and utilities of the players. We find that the bias in allocation that occurs when the government and the industry enter a ‘nexus’ can be rectified when there is resistance from the indigenous groups. Moreover, rebellion is a dominant strategy of the indigenous community, irrespective of whether there is ‘nexus’ or not, and being in ‘nexus’ with the government is a best response for the industry. The unique SPNE occurs when there is ‘nexus’ between the industry and the government and resistance by the indigenous groups, corroborating the widespread allegations of ‘nexus’ and evidence of resistance worldwide.

This line of research, however, assumes that autocratic regimes are monolithic and that they have similar capacities to resist foreign pressure. This study argues that the success rate of sanctions against dictatorships is contingent on institutional differences across different types of autocracies. I develop a theoretical model indicating that single-party and military regimes are less likely to concede to foreign pressure compared to democracies. This is because they effectively use various repressive tactics and positive inducements to endure the costs of the coercion. Sanctions against personalist regimes, on the other hand, are likely to be as effective as sanctions directed at democracies. Personalist regimes might be inclined to acquiesce to foreign pressure due to their lack of strong institutional capacity to weather the costs of the sanctions. Results from the selection-corrected models show that sanctions against military or single-party regimes are less likely to induce concessions relative to democratic target regimes. The findings also indicate that there is no significant difference in the success rate of sanctions against personalist regimes and democratic governments.","Defence and Peace Economics","253-268","3","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1368258","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1368258","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:3:p:253-268","4",NA

We find that the gross benefits of the chosen strategy of secession and war far exceed anything that could be achieved by the peaceful alternative. A conjectural assessment of perceived costs suggests that also net benefits were maximized by the war strategy.

To test the argument, we gathered data for over 125 emerging economies for the years from 1970 to 2005. The findings indicate that sanctions are likely to raise the probability of banking crises. The results also show that financial sanctions are more detrimental to the stability of banking systems than trade sanctions. Further, we find that the hypothesized effect of sanctions is conditioned by the extent of economic cost inflicted on targeted economies. One major implication of the findings is that sanctions, as external shocks, can potentially destabilize the financial stability of target countries in addition to the well-documented adverse effects on economic growth, political stability, and humanitarian conditions.","Defence and Peace Economics","171-189","2","29","2018",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2016.1245811","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2016.1245811","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:29:y:2018:i:2:p:171-189","2",NA

We apply the band spectrum regression estimator, and the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform, to a panel of 60 developing countries, for the years 1990 to 2013. The estimated results indicate that military expenditure, in the absence of armed conflict, reduces FDI inflow. However, the negative effect is mitigated by increased military expenditure, in the presence of armed conflict. We also show that the effect of military expenditure on FDI is time sensitive, in that it takes time for military expenditure to affect FDI inflow. FDI inflow in response to higher military expenditure is higher for the country that faces higher armed conflict than the country that faces lower armed conflict. The findings are robust in the case of overall as well as internal conflict. These results are also robust to the alternative specification, subsample analysis with different armed conflict thresholds, and the estimation using the time variant long-run models.","Defence and Peace Economics","238-251","2","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1388066","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1388066","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:2:p:238-251","2",NA

A possible method consists of realizing economies of scale through the concentration of maintenance activities, which involves the spatial reorganization of existing industrial sites dedicated to MRO. This article provides a formalized framework to discuss the optimal organization for the MRO of defense platforms in space. The public planner organizes the maintenance of defense platforms with only two possible spatial configurations. In the dispersed configuration, two industrial production units in charge of the maintenance optimally cover space, whereas in the concentrated configuration, a unique industrial unit covers space. Focusing on the tipping point between the two configurations, the balance of forces between agglomeration and dispersion in defense support activities is described and discussed. On the one hand, economies of scale provide an opportunity to optimize defense support costs, favoring concentration in a unique industrial unit. On the other hand, space causes dispersion to reduce both transport costs and operational social costs. This trade-off illustrates a general principle in spatial economics with an application to MRO production in the French case.","Defence and Peace Economics","159-175","2","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1461791","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1461791","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:2:p:159-175","2",NA

Data include information about social and military background, and motives for more than 600 soldiers, 444 of whom answered the survey both before and after deployment.

To conceptualize motives among soldiers, we use factor analysis and find three factors: challenge, self-benefit, and fidelity. Challenge represents an occupational orientation; fidelity, an institutional orientation; and self-benefit, a desire for adventure. Exploiting the within-subject design of our data, we find that pre- and post-deployment motives vary significantly according to the type of mission and soldiers’ previous experiences (first-timers or experienced soldiers). Our results suggest that after the mission, peace-keepers are generally more disappointed than peace-enforcers.

The ADF, P-P, and ADF-GLS unit root tests are applied to test the integrating order of the variables. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and error correction method regressions are used to investigate the marginal impact of military spending on external debt in the long and short run. Our findings indicate the existence of cointegration that confirms the presence of a long-run relationship among military spending, external debt, economic growth, and investment. Further, our results reveal that a rise in military spending increases the stock of external debt; an increase in investment also increases external debt; however, there is an inverse effect of economic growth on external debt. An implication of the findings reported herein is that there is a need to formulate a comprehensive economic policy for curtailing external debt in case of Pakistan.","Defence and Peace Economics","718-741","5","27","2016",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2012.724878","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2012.724878","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:27:y:2016:i:5:p:718-741","9",NA

By distinguishing between the decision to export arms (extensive margin) and the value of the arms exported (intensive margin), while also considering its interdependence, is what differentiates this paper from previous research. A theoretically justified gravity model of trade augmented with political and security motives is estimated using a two-stage panel data approach for 104 exporting countries over the period from 1950 to 2007. In addition to the usual gravity variables related to the economic mass of the trading countries and the trade cost factors, the model is extended with political and security factors. The level of democracy in both trading partners, political differences between trading partners and voting similarity with the United States in the UN General Assembly of the countries engaged in trade are the main political factors, whereas the existence of conflicts, military pacts, and embargoes are taken as security motives. The key result indicates that both political and security motives are an important determinant of an arms trade, but their effects on the extensive margin of exports (the decision to order a transfer) differs from their effect on the intensive margin (average value of exports). Moreover, the relative importance of the factors under study has changed since 1989. In the post-cold war period, countries that are less democratic are more likely to export arms, military pacts are less relevant and embargoes play a role.","Defence and Peace Economics","2-26","1","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1324722","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1324722","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:1:p:2-26","1",NA

Water Scarcity and the Duration and Outcomes of Civil Wars","Recent anecdotal evidence from the civil wars in Somalia and Yemen suggest that water scarcity may shape the dynamics of civil wars. While a considerable body of research has examined the connection between water scarcity (such as low rainfall) and the onset of civil war, very little research has examined how water scarcity may shape the duration and outcomes of civil wars. Looking specifically at rainfall, this paper argues that changes in access to water play a key role in the duration of civil wars. As rainfall declines, there is a reduction in resources available to both the government and the rebel group, leading to a stalemate in fighting. Furthermore, this paper argues that declines in rainfall are felt more acutely by rebel groups who seek to challenge the government through conventional warfare. This paper tests these propositions using hazard models. The results provide robust support for the propositions.","Defence and Peace Economics","27-45","1","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1320184","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1320184","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:1:p:27-45","1",NA

A new indicator, referred to as fiscal capacity, is defined and used as a candidate explanatory variable in an empirical model of European defence spending over the 2007&#x2013;2016 period. Fiscal capacity is found to outperform simpler measurements of economic conditions, notably GDP growth forecasts, in explaining changes in defence spending efforts as a share of GDP. Regarding security environment variables, the results suggest that Russia has recently come to be seen as a potential military threat by European nations, leading to defence spending increases, the more so the shorter the distance to stationed or deployed Russian forces, and particularly so by those European nations that have a land border with Russia.

A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown to be capitalised in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws.","Defence and Peace Economics","85-97","1","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1335366","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1335366","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:1:p:85-97","1",NA

Arms transfers provide importers an avenue to gain security without having to rely on alliances. Past research uses aggregate measures of the monetary or security value of major weapon system transfers without accounting for strategic differences in possible use in interstate and civil conflict. This article presents a data set on interstate transfers of major weapon systems between 1950 and 2010 building upon Stockholm Peach Research Institute’s Arms Trade Register with several improvements. First, it disaggregates land weapons and air weapons into categories reflecting their strategic capabilities. Second, model level characteristics (e.g. age, speed, and range) are drawn from Jane’s Defence sources. Additionally, the data set covers a larger range of time and states than previous data sets categorizing arms. To demonstrate the usefulness, this article first presents summary statistics of the data set and then replicates an earlier test to show that the effect of human rights and regime types on United States transfers differs across the categories of arms compared to alternative measures of arms transfers.","Defence and Peace Economics","272-297","3","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2015.1033894","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2015.1033894","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:3:p:272-297","5",NA

This relationship is developed within a multiple-period arms race model between two rivals. Using this model and stylized data for the Israeli–Syrian arms race, we show that an appropriate budget shift from defense to civilian expenditures during the initial periods of the planning horizon will gradually (over a decade, say) increase the quality of human capital in the country and, thus, the effectiveness of its intelligence, which, in turn, will increase the country’s future security and welfare.","Defence and Peace Economics","367-399","3","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2015.1101885","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2015.1101885","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:3:p:367-399","5",NA

To improve treatment outcomes, it is important to identify risk factors for insomnia and sedative-hypnotic use. Classification and regression trees and logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with insomnia or sedative-hypnotic use. Key findings include low insomnia diagnosis rates (3.5–5.6%) and high rates of sedative-hypnotics (44.2–49.0%). Younger Veterans and those without a breathing-related sleep disorder (BRSD) were more likely to receive an insomnia diagnosis. Veterans with greater service connection and those with an alcohol/substance use disorder were more likely to be prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Interaction terms may have identified potential groups at risk of being under-diagnosed with insomnia (i.e. non-black Veterans with psychiatric co-morbidity, black Veterans without psychiatric co-morbidity) as well as groups at risk for sedative-hypnotic use (i.e. younger Veterans without BRSD). In sum, Veterans with PTSD have high rates of sedative-hypnotic use despite minimal evidence they are effective. This is counter to recommendations indicating behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment.

An empirical investigation of the hypothesis presents a challenge due to concerns of endogeneity and selection: the post-conflict level of democracy is endogenous to the pre-conflict level. Further, for a given time period, either a number of countries have not experienced civil war; or if they did, did not resolve the conflict. We overcome this selection bias by implementing a three-step extension to the Heckman procedure using an unbalanced cross-country panel of 77 countries over the period 1971–2005. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that a standard deviation improvement in the existing level of democracy reduces the probability of civil war by approximately 9 percentage points and a corresponding improvement in expected post-conflict democratization increases the probability of conflict by approximately 48 percentage points.","Defence and Peace Economics","165-187","2","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2016.1142745","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2016.1142745","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:2:p:165-187","3",NA

Numerical simulations of the static solution of the government’s welfare maximization problem reveal that the optimal rate of spending on SC (m*) is negatively related with the income share of physical capital, SC spillovers and fiscal decentralization. Simulations also show that SC homogeneity is positively associated with both the level and equitability of aggregate income.

Reducing the ratio of military spending to GDP is beneficial for countries with low HDI scores; however, moderately increasing the share of military expenditure is favorable for countries with extremely high HDI scores.

The findings are consistent with the negative effect of civil war on economic growth from an exodus of skilled workers. We further investigated the factors that drive migration from Sri Lanka to a major migration destination, namely Australia, for educated and skilled Sri Lankans. We regressed the growth rate of the Sri Lankan-born population in Australia on a civil war dummy variable, per worker Australian gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for the restrictiveness of Australian immigration policy and an estimated labour wedge that represents labour market inefficiency in Sri Lanka. We found that Sri Lankan immigrants in Australia increased with per worker GDP in Australia, civil war and labour market inefficiency in Sri Lanka. The finding suggests that excessive protection of insiders in the Sri Lankan labour market should be abolished to mitigate migration outflows that have continued since the end of the civil war.","Defence and Peace Economics","783-798","7","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1428786","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1428786","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:7:p:783-798","11",NA

It is also commonly associated with an escalation in intensity and organization of collective and interpersonal violence. In some cases, arms are illegally transferred via diversion from existing stores. In this article, we consider the leakage from military to civilian markets as an important source of ammunition available to civilians in Haiti. We employ a unique section-quarterly panel of ammunition prices on the Haitian civilian market over the period July 2004–July 2012. These data are combined with publicly available monthly data on authorized ammunition shipments to the country registered by the United Nations (UN) and Haitian National Police (HNP). We use a standard time-series Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model to show that the exogenous shocks of UN- and HNP-ordered ammunition exert measurable downward pressure on civilian ammunition markets, which we calculate in terms of adjusted predictions and partial elasticities of demand. These effects constitute econometric evidence that the firewall that should in theory have separated military and civilian markets in Haiti partially broke down. We conclude with a suggestion for using this model to help estimate the specific size of the leakage.","Defence and Peace Economics","799-812","7","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1492226","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1492226","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:7:p:799-812","11",NA

The paper investigates the effect of civilian unemployment on the rate of applications from individuals aged 18–25 to initiate basic military training, using panel data on Swedish counties for the period 2011–2015. A linear fixed-effects model is estimated to investigate the relationship, while controlling for a range of socio-demographic covariates, unobserved heterogeneity on the regional level, as well as aggregate trends on the national level. The results of the panel-data analysis indicate that the unemployment rate has a positive and statistically significant effect on the application rate. These results are robust to non-linear form specifications, as well as allowing the civilian unemployment rate to be endogenous. As such, the results suggest that the civilian labour market environment in Sweden can give rise to non-trivial fluctuations in the supply of applications to initiate basic military training within the Swedish Armed Forces.","Defence and Peace Economics","813-829","7","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1522572","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1522572","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:7:p:813-829","11",NA

After controlling for geographical distance, bilateral trade, and political characteristics, a negative relationship is found between the duration of invasion and number of related deaths in the invaded regions and their governments’ efforts in assisting Japan after the earthquake. Further analysis shows that political similarity to Japan helped in assisting them after the earthquake, but this effect was reduced for regions that sustained many deaths during the Japanese invasion. In addition, a mediation effect test shows that the help extended by Japan to several countries after the war through the Japanese official development assistance did not positively influence the amount of aid provided by such regions to Japan after the earthquake.

While the foreign legal person shares and the shareholding ratio of executives and managers have no significant impact. (2) As for the financial indicators, coefficients of firm size, asset tangibility, and growth are positive, while those of profitability, non-debt tax shield, and growth opportunity are negative. (3) Given the civil–military integration strategy, equity financing imposes a negative impact on the capital structure of military enterprises. The negative impact increases, with the increase in military enterprises’ profitability, business risk, and growth opportunities, and with the decrease in military enterprises’ growth and firm size. (4) The negative impacts of equity financing are significant, if debt ratios of the military enterprises are too small or too large. While the state-owned shares only have significant negative impact on military enterprises whose debt ratios are too small.

This paper describes recent efforts at SIPRI that have succeeded in extending these consistent series for most countries back to at least the 1960s, and in some cases to 1949. It describes the underlying difficulties involved in collecting military expenditure data and ensuring consistent series, the sources used in the reconstruction of the long data-set, the methodological choices made, and the results of the exercise. Overall, consistent constant price data series have been extended back as far as 1957 for half of the countries covered by the SIPRI database that existed at the time. Europe and the Americas generally have the best data coverage. One of the biggest problems with the extended data-set is the extensive use of estimates to splice together overlapping, but disagreeing series for the same country, adjusting the older series upwards or downwards by an appropriate ratio to give greater consistency with the later series. A number of case studies are investigated where parallel series exist for countries, suggesting that this approach may in some cases involve significant margins for error.","Defence and Peace Economics","404-421","4","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1279782","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1279782","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:4:p:404-421","7",NA

The recent literature on the determinants of military expenditures has mainly focused on countries’ external security environments and their regime type. Based on existing theoretical work, we argue that, in addition to these factors, arms trade flows may have an important role to play. First, we show that rising imports of major conventional weapons do not necessarily translate into higher defense spending. Rather, this relationship depends on political, economic, and contract conditions that influence different choices of financing imports. Therefore, the effect should be very heterogenous. Second, exports may have both a negative or a positive impact depending on regime type and the perceived impact of exports on national security. We empirically test these expectations for 156 countries from 1949 to 2013 using arms trade and new military expenditure data provided by SIPRI. Employing static and dynamic panel data models, we find that the effect of arms imports on defense budgets does indeed differ between regions and time periods. With respect to exports, there is evidence of a strategic substitution effect between military expenditures and arms exports in democratic countries: increases in arms exports are followed by a reduction in military expenditures. For non-democratic societies on the other hand, arms exports do not tend to be associated with lower military spending.","Defence and Peace Economics","457-472","4","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2016.1277452","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2016.1277452","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:4:p:457-472","7",NA

We focus on selected countries in Indo-Pacific Asia – an economically diverse but increasingly prosperous region with pockets of strategic competition and growing milex. We confirm the robustness of SIPRI’s milex data by corroborating it with defence budget data published by Australia’s Defence Intelligence Organisation (ADIO). We find no conclusive evidence of an arms race in the region. It is the growing economic prosperity that accounts for most of the growth in Indo-Pacific Asia’s milex. But we also find wide variations in the economic burden imposed by milex at the national level and that milex’ high level of aggregation masks important changes in national military capabilities. We argue that such capabilities can increase despite a constant or even declining milex burden and, hence, prejudice the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and, thus, undermine the fragile regional stability. We propose limited disaggregation of milex to highlight national spending on military force structure and preparedness so as to facilitate better understanding of military capability formation.","Defence and Peace Economics","473-490","4","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2016.1274059","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2016.1274059","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:4:p:473-490","7",NA

We address this gap by analyzing determinants of contribution levels to CSDP operations. In employing an innovative multi-method design that combines insights from collection action theory with those from integrated theories of military burden sharing, our results indicate that EU countries tend to contribute in positive disproportion with their capabilities when they have a strong peacekeeping tradition and elections are distant.

First, I prove that the multicollinearity problem can be resolved by standardization. Second, externality, which is judged to conventionally exist, is not found.

Empirical Evidence from China","This study examines the causal nexus between defence spending and education expenditure in China using the bootstrap Granger full-sample causality test and sub-sample rolling window estimation. The full-sample result indicates that there is no causality between defence spending and education expenditure. By adopting a time-varying rolling window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationships, this article identifies a negative unidirectional causality running from education expenditure to defence spending. The finding suggests that it is the education expenditure crowds out defence spending in China rather than reverse.

In particular, we test whether the characteristics of large defence companies are related to both the production of different types of patents (civilian, military and mixed), and the generation of dual-use technologies. To explore these links, we rely on economic data for the top 100 defence companies from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, and patent information from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database. Our results show that the relationship between the production of civilian patents and the size of the company is positive and significant. However, this relationship does not hold for the production of military patents. Furthermore, the military commercial profile is unrelated to the generation of military patents. Regarding the involvement in dual-use technologies, firms engaged in dual-use are those with higher military sales, a greater number of employees and a larger number of patents (civilian, military and mixed) than those not engaged in dual-use. Furthermore, we found a skill effect (more involvement in dual-use per employee) in European firms compared to US firms. These findings help to identify which firms should be targeted by government policies if increasing dual-use technologies becomes a political objective.","Defence and Peace Economics","821-839","7","29","2018",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1303239","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1303239","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:29:y:2018:i:7:p:821-839","11",NA

From 1937 to December 1941, the country was engaged in a land war of attrition in China. This war requested an immense amount of resources and was associated with armaments procurement strategy with emphasis in the army. However, the Japanese strategic vision assumed that the state was strong enough to engage in one land war against China and in a naval war in the Pacific simultaneously. The basis of Japanese strategy was a utopia. Making things worse, the naval war in the Pacific was conducted against the most industrialized powers in the world [the US and the British Empire (Britain, Australia, India, etc.)]. Finally, the internal Japanese industrial mobilization was associated with immense errors in armaments production (absence of economies of scale and scope, limited raw materials, etc.).

A Critical Review of the Sanctions Effectiveness Literature","There is growing policy consensus in Washington and other Western capitals that economic sanctions are powerful tools to cope with major foreign policy crises. Are sanctions, particularly targeted sanctions, really the potent instruments optimists suggest? Under what circumstances do punitive economic measures induce policy change in sanctioned countries? To probe these queries, in this article I outline the conditions that have been identified as more likely to lead to successful sanctions outcomes in the literature. I also discuss four major shortcomings of existing scholarship. First, the sender-biased interpretation of sanctions effectiveness renders the treatment of the ‘ineffective’ cases with negative outcomes the same as those cases that induce no discernable change in target behavior. Second, the prevalent use of static data from existing sanctions databases reduces the ability of researchers to study various time-specific factors affecting the probability of sanctions success. Third, the dominant state-centric bargaining model in the literature offers limited insight into contemporary coercive measures directed at non-state actors. Fourth, the study of sanctions in isolation of other instruments that frequently accompany them, such as incentives and diplomatic pressure, leads to a partial understanding of the specific role sanctions play in shaping the outcome of key foreign policy initiatives.","Defence and Peace Economics","635-647","6","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1625250","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1625250","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:6:p:635-647","9",NA

U.S. economic sanctions play a role of leading autocratic targets to change social policy through two theoretical channels. First, U.S. economic sanctions may reduce autocrats’ resources to buy off supports from ruling elite groups and so force autocrats to reallocate government expenditure in favor of their supporting groups. Consequently, autocrats facing longer U.S. sanctions are likely to cut spending on public goods and services, especially on education and health care spending. Second, the impacts of U.S. sanction duration on social spending vary according to political variables such as autocrats’ pseudo-democratic institutions. The empirical findings show that, even when U.S. sanctions last a long time, autocrats under nominal democratic institutions cut spending on education and health to a lesser degree than do autocrats with no such institutions. In contrast, autocrats relying on pseudo-democratic institutions reduce social security spending a little more than did non-institutionalized autocrats.","Defence and Peace Economics","648-665","6","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2017.1392832","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2017.1392832","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:6:p:648-665","9",NA

Examples range from killers who have been waging jihad against European Jews to unattached mass killers such as the Germanwings pilot to the perpetrators of mass school shootings in America and worldwide. We argue that these phenomena can be understood as instances of the Herostratos syndrome, which has been known for thousands of years as characterizing the behavior of people who seek to survive in the collective memory by excelling in their infamous acts. We provide a model of hybrid killers which accommodates the Herostratic motive alongside a political motive and characterize a well-behaved Nash equilibrium where Herostratic killers are competing with one another with a view to make a name for themselves in infamy.

We find that four-fifths of NATO member countries have been convergent with the UK, but no country’s military expenditure is convergent with the US. This means that there is no significant linkage effect in the US for NATO military expenditure. While they are allies of the US, the majority of NATO member countries’ military expenditures are consistent with UK military expenditure. The main reasons are due to the geographical space layout and the international relationship convergence.

This paper considers this issue, using an endogenous growth model estimated on a large sample of 109 non-high-income countries for the period 1998–2012. The empirical analysis is framed within an instrumental variable setting that exploits the increase in military spending that occurs when unrest in a country escalates to turmoil. The estimation results show that endogeneity arising from reverse causality is a crucial issue, with the instrumental variable estimates providing a larger significant negative effect of military spending on growth than OLS would.

This paper examines the growth and fiscal consequences of terrorism in Nigeria by estimating the terrorism–macroeconomy relation using different measures of terror incidence. The results show that terrorism has an economically and statistically significant negative impact on growth; although this impact is considerably small and short-lived, manifesting only after a lag of about three years. Specifically, the cost of terrorism to Nigeria, in terms of lost GDP per annum, is estimated at 0.82%. Moreover, there is evidence that terrorism leads to the reallocation of economic activity away from private investment spending to government spending; that is, terrorism crowds out investment at a higher rate than its potential to crowd in government spending. Lastly, terrorism alters the composition of government expenditure – with the defence component of government expenditure rising vis-a-vis other expenditure items.

It appears that deployment significantly increases the possibility of terrorist actions in the home country. In particular, if country A decides to send troops to nation B, then citizens of the former country are more likely to fall victim of an attack carried out by a terrorist organisation originating from the latter country. Contributing to this line of literature, we further refine this relationship by distinguishing between regions where the troops are sent as well as by introducing differences between types of deployment. Our results indicate that missions to Asia and the Middle East are more dangerous than missions to other regions as reflected by the terrorist threat in the home country. Robustness tests do however show that the significance of the location variable Asia is predominantly attributed to the mission to Afghanistan. As for types of deployment, only ad hoc missions seem to increase the risk of an attack, whereas no significant results are found for other missions such as operations under UN and NATO flag. Leaving out the missions to Iraq and Afghanistan however also increases the danger resulting from missions by fixed coalitions.

Procured from 1997 to 2003, the 47-foot MLB is the standard lifeboat of the USCG and all 117 MLBs remain in service. The aging of the MLB fleet has resulted in higher annual operating costs and lower operational availability, although the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Our estimation strategy utilizes an error components estimator to examine these issues. We employ three variants of the dependent variables (i.e. the standard logarithmic transformation as is most commonly seen in the literature, inverse hyperbolic sine [IHS], and level outcomes). The point estimates from the standard logarithmic model finds operational availability for the MLBs decreases at a rate between 0.83 and 1.8% per year and cost increases at a rate between 0.33 and 7.81% per year. Similar effects are shown with the IHS and level outcome specifications.

Theories on the economic impacts of military expenditure greatly differ and include arguments that they either enhance economic growth or crowd out productive investments. Empirical literature on defence expenditure and economic growth nexus generally employs linear specifications to investigate the impact of defence expenditures on economic growth. Although it is now well established that many economic variables may have a non-linear data-generating mechanism, it seems that this reality has long been neglected in empirical work on defence–growth nexus. This paper attempts to fill this gap by employing non-linear panel data models to examine the effects of military expenditures on economic growth for Middle Eastern countries and Turkey, for the time period 1988–2012. Results show that the effect of military expenditure on economic growth is nonlinear such that the state of the economy actually determines the effect of the former on the latter.

There are conflicting views regarding whether the defence expenditure is capable of reducing income inequality. Therefore, this paper investigates the existence of any spillover effect of defence expenditure on income inequality, with a special focus on the regional differences among 31 provinces and 7 military regions in China. We extend panel cointegration and the impulse response function by using panel data during the period of 1997–2012. The empirical results show that the defence expenditure has an impact on income inequality, and the effect varies over different regions in China. The defence expenditure has a spillover effect on income inequality in the full sample panel and the southeastern panel. An increase in the defence expenditure does not crowd out social welfare spending due to the high level of economic development and government expenditure. On the contrary, in the northern panel, the effect is opposite because of the unbalanced economic development levels within the panel. Beijing as the capital of China, benefits more from the expansion of defence expenditure thus widening the income gap. In addition, the impulse response analyses further confirm a stronger effect of the defence expenditure on income inequality in the northern and the southeastern panels over a short period.","Defence and Peace Economics","731-749","6","28","2017",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2016.1245812","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2016.1245812","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:28:y:2017:i:6:p:731-749","11",NA

SRBs are targeted to specific military occupations for which reenlistment rates are lower (or expected to be lower) than what is needed. This article first identifies four primary sources of biases affecting these models: reverse causality from supply shifts (a negative bias), the endogeneity of the decision point causing coded SRBs to be higher for reenlisters than leavers (a positive bias), measurement error (a likely negative bias), and excess supply preventing the full effect of an SRB change to materialize (a positive or negative bias). The report proceeds to develop a model that attempts to address the first two biases. With U.S. Navy data from FY2001-FY2008, I examine the extent to which these two biases are affecting the estimated SRB effects.

The results illustrate that objective risk, signified by violence in the district of residence, and victimization play an important role in the formation of perceived insecurity. Moreover, males and residents of rural areas feel more insecure than females and urban residents, respectively. Furthermore, spatial variation in violence indicates that terrorist attacks in the first-order contiguous districts (i.e. the immediate neighbors) are also associated with subjective insecurity.

In this paper, we outline several possible reasons as to why operating costs increase at higher rates in defence, including differences in the input factor mix and productivity growth, the technological complexity required to maintain the relative effect of weapon systems and a gradual reduction in the number of units and activity. We investigate whether operating costs grow at a faster rate than elsewhere in the economy, by estimating growth in real output unit costs in the Norwegian Armed Forces for the period 1994–2013, using activity as a measure of output.

Spatial autoregression estimates are next presented for 1991–2015, founded on alternative kinds of country connectivities, such as contiguity, inverse distance, discrete distance, and power-projection considerations. Finally, 11 select countries’ demands for defense equations are estimated using seemingly unrelated regressions. From alternative perspectives, these estimated models indicate how Asia-Pacific countries respond to the defense spending of other countries. In the spatial runs, free riding is prevalent despite the growing military might of China, which apparently is not generally viewed as a threat. For the sample period, the projection of Chinese or American power is a relevant spatial factor. The main threat is reflected in non-U.S. allies’ reaction to U.S. allies’ defense spending during 1991–2015 and to Chinese defense spending after 2002.","Defence and Peace Economics","381-401","4","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1434375","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1434375","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:4:p:381-401","6",NA

Although sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) debt was cut by two-thirds by 2008, through two debt relief programmes, debt in the region has since been rising at an increasingly rapid pace. This study provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of external debt in SSA over the period 1960–2016, using dynamic panel methods. It also considers two potentially important factors that have received relatively little attention. One is military spending, rarely considered, despite a number of well-publicised scandals over the procurement of unnecessary and expensive high-tech weapons systems. A second, is the possibility that the countries studied have been involved in conflict. The empirical results point to a positive impact of military spending on external debt, but with some evidence of heterogeneity across the countries. Furthermore, findings indicate that the positive effect of military expenditure on debt becomes more marked in countries that have been affected by conflict. These results imply that policies to improve security and reduce military spending could be beneficial in reducing external debt and, potentially, improving economic performance in the region.","Defence and Peace Economics","462-473","4","30","2019",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1556996","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1556996","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:30:y:2019:i:4:p:462-473","6",NA

Previous experiences opening closed occupations to women suggest that a variety of specific strategies are likely to be helpful to the Marines’ integration efforts.

It also compares these women to men who served in the same capacities and women who served in lower risk occupations. Women in general, and in these occupations in particular, were more likely than their male counterparts to use the GI bill. Following deployment, this paper presents robust evidence that women in all capacities, and men, were more likely to use their GI bill benefits. Moreover, exposure to intense combat, which was far more likely to impact these women than other women, detracted from their propensity to use the GI bill. This negative impact on pursuit of higher education was similar for both men and women. Taken together, this paper provides evidence that deployment may benefit the young men and women alike who serve in the U.S. military, and that both suffer together when faced with exposure to intense fighting.","Defence and Peace Economics","34-47","1","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1467104","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1467104","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:1:p:34-47","1",NA

Meanwhile, China’s stock market has suffered from dramatic fluctuations. This article, therefore, attempts to break new ground on an empirical research agenda to detect bubbles in the defence sector of China’s stock market and how these bubbles can be impacted by the entire stock market and defence industry. To explain this issue, sequential unit root tests are introduced to investigate the existence of bubbles in the defence sector using monthly frequency data from China’s stock market from January 2005 to June 2016. The empirical results show strong evidence of explosive behaviours in the defence sector during the past decade. Moreover, the number of bubbles has changed greatly when accounting for the entire stock market. The empirical results indicate that bubbles in the middle of 2006 and at the end of 2014 were driven by the defence industry because of the sharp increase of military expenditure and the release of innovative defence reforms.

Among these is the ability to successfully strike against well-defended or ‘hard’ targets. Scholars argue that because suicide attacks produce higher levels of damage and do not require an escape route for the perpetrator, they are particularly effective against hard targets. Consequently, militants should be expected to use such attacks more frequently, and successfully, against hard targets. This study empirically tests this contention using incident-level data on between 22,000 and 170,000 terrorist attacks in between 154 and 175 countries for the period 1970–2016. It makes two key findings. First, suicide attacks are both more frequently deployed against hard targets, and are more often successfully executed against hard targets. Second, this finding is not a product of foreign military interventions, as previous literature might suggest. Suicide attacks are found to be more likely to be launched against, with success, both domestic and foreign military targets.

Indeed, foreign terrorist organizations with various ideological profiles have repeatedly justified attacks against U.S. interests as punishment for the (purported) special relationship between the United States and Israel. We analyze the effect of various measures of U.S. support for Israel (e.g. U.S. military assistance to Israel) on anti-American terrorism for the period 1970–2014. Using both time-series and panel approaches, we do not find that more U.S. support for Israel systematically translates into more anti-American terrorism. Rather, other systemic (e.g. U.S. dominance in the international system) and local conditions (e.g. local state failure) are found to predict the patterns of anti-American terrorism. However, as a qualification to these general findings, we also provide some (preliminary) evidence that for terrorism originating from the Middle East and Northern Africa a favorable U.S. policy stance towards Israel may indeed contribute to more anti-American terrorism.","Defence and Peace Economics","160-176","2","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1560558","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1560558","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:2:p:160-176","2",NA

We investigate the impact of security assistance on human rights conditions after 171 internal armed conflicts that ended between 1956 and 2012 using a novel measure of military aid and an instrumented measure of weapons transfers.

There is, however, a puzzle: why is this kind of procurement so rare? This paper introduces a bargaining model with forward-looking expectations about the scale of procurement. It is shown that the price sensitivity of the scale of acquisition is favourable for the buying partnership, as it tends to push down the bargaining price. We propose several explanations for why it is hard to align buyers’ incentives: First, preferences for the properties of the products are country-specific, with divergent implications for national security. Second, countries that place a low value on the product have more bargaining power than those that value it highly, and may require a side payment in order to enter a partnership, while the partner may not have sufficient incentives to make such a payment. Third, the gains from cooperative procurement for the producer may not be sufficient to compensate for conflicting preferences among contractors. Fourth, while the future unpredictability of technologies or the future risks of deteriorating national security might support longer-term cooperative procurement, short-term opportunism tends to prevent long-term commitments.","Defence and Peace Economics","201-219","2","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1471320","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1471320","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:2:p:201-219","2",NA

Our results suggest that, among the set of regressors considered, those reflecting labor market conditions and economic prospects tend to receive high posterior inclusion probabilities. These findings are robust to changes in the model specification and sample composition and are not meaningfully affected by the generalized linear regression model applied.

Because the distribution of workers’ individual characteristics, such as skills, and the ‘returns’ to these characteristics may differ across workers, the wage differential is decomposed into two components: an ‘endowment’ effect and a ‘returns’ effect. The results show that in the pre-Intifada period, the wage gap between the public and private sectors narrowed in both the West Bank and Gaza. However, a sharp increase is seen after the outbreak of the Intifada. Moreover, most of this increase comes from an increase in ‘returns’ to skills composition in the public sector, (unexplained effect), rather than a change in the skills composition of public sector workers, (explained effect). Using recent econometric quantile regression techniques, the analysis of the public–private sector wage gap from 1998 to 2006, at various points along the wage distribution, shows that the wage premium, (penalty), for the public sector varies across the distribution, being higher, (lower), at the lowest end of the wage distribution and decreasing (increasing) along the wage distribution; it becomes negative in the top percentiles.","Defence and Peace Economics","289-314","3","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1473137","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1473137","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:3:p:289-314","4",NA

Such situations can be demonstrated by the cases of Cambodia, Uganda and Zimbabwe where the political leadership has used repression in and around the election times. In a collusive equilibrium, the security forces produce violence and the leader responds by giving a bribe to the former, this pair of actions taking place in each period. A collusive equilibrium exists when the bribe that a leader is prepared to pay is at least as large as the bribe that the security forces are willing to accept. We find that a harsher expected punishment (e.g. a longer prison sentence) will improve an incumbent’s incentives to collude. In contrast, security forces expecting a harsher punishment will be less likely to repress. Furthermore, we discuss the circumstances under which windfall revenue (e.g. foreign aid, resource rents) may contribute to violence and when it may prevent it.","Defence and Peace Economics","341-360","3","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1472999","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1472999","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:3:p:341-360","4",NA

The results illustrate that the relationship is stronger at the short- to medium-term horizon of less than eight years than it is in the long term. No positive leading effect of defense spending on inflation is demonstrated, showing that defense spending is not inflationary in China. The results indicate that inflation lowers the defense spending growth rate at short and medium scales, particularly in peace time. This study provides new insights into the nexus between defense spending and inflation and emphasizes that such a correlation has time and frequency features.

It does this by developing the model of Mauro (2004) in the context of an endogenous growth model to deal with corruption in the defence sector. It then uses data from the International Country Risk Guide to produce a novel measure of corruption that combines corruption within the political system, institutional strength, quality of bureaucracy and the degree of military participation in the country and estimates the model for a large panel of countries. The results suggest that both military spending (as a share of total government spending) and corruption have significant negative long run effects on output. As the model also suggests that multiple equilibria can exist, a comparison is made between high and low corruption groups of countries and clear differences are indeed found. This suggests that effort is needed to encourage and coerce high corruption and military spending countries, but low corruption and military spending countries are likely to need little attention.","Defence and Peace Economics","423-433","4","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1751503","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1751503","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:4:p:423-433","6",NA

Dragnet-controls confine citizens’ liberties, but may help to detect criminals. Using data from the 16 German states over the period 1995–2017, I show that rightwing governments have been active in implementing dragnet-controls and leftwing governments have denied dragnet-controls since the mid 1990s. When evaluating how government/party ideology influences individual policies, previous econometric studies ignored initiatives in parliament. My study also considers initiatives in parliament. I conjecture that, since 2015, the rightwing CDU has used initiatives to introduce/extend dragnet-controls to also deal with the upcoming threat of rightwing populism.

Moreover, past protests by defense companies have generated significant costs, and triggered dangerous delays of critical defense equipment, materiel, services, and supplies required for national security. The static, probabilistic, micro-economic, partial equilibrium, representative bidder model presented in this paper offers a cautionary tale for defense organizations, government agencies, countries, and international institutions that authorize bid protests.

Theoretical arguments in the field of international relations suggest that economic sanctions lead to militarized tensions and conflicts among states. In this research, we argue that the relationship between economic sanctions and military conflict is two-way (i.e. sanctions cause conflict, and conflict causes sanctions) rather than one-way. Using sanctions data (Threat and Imposition of Sanctions v4.0) and conflict data (Correlates of War Militarized Interstate Disputes v4.2; International Crisis Behavior v12), we find that the relationship is mutually causative.

This study adopted an extended neoclassical production function framework utilising the autoregressive distributed lag approach to investigate the causal relationships. Estimation showed that a 1% increase in military expenditure led to a 0.63% decrease in GDP, whereas a 1% increase in energy consumption increased GDP by 4% in the long run.

Policy recommendations promoting Myanmar’s economic growth include reducing military spending which would contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions and encourage efficient energy consumption.","Defence and Peace Economics","615-641","6","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2018.1560566","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2018.1560566","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:6:p:615-641","08",NA

The network allows players to receive goods from one or more producers through directed paths. Each agent is endowed with a finite and divisible defence resource that can be allocated to their own security or to that of their peers. The external threat is represented by either a random attack on one of the nodes or by an intelligent attacker who aims to maximize the flow-disruption by seeking to destroy one node. We show that under certain conditions a decentralized defence allocation is efficient when we assume the attacker to be strategic: a centralized allocation of defence resources which minimizes the flow-disruption coincides with a decentralized equilibrium allocation. On the other hand, when we assume a random attack, the decentralized allocation is likely to diverge from the central planner’s allocation.","Defence and Peace Economics","659-676","6","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1587679","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1587679","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:6:p:659-676","08",NA

Due to the relative inaccessibility of key information, geopolitics is hard to study even if it is a crucial element to shape our era. To fill the gap, we adopt a copula approach to surmise a joint probability distribution between the GPR in the world and several countries. This method could capture tail dependence. The highest upper tail dependence with the world’s GPR has been that of Israel; as one moves from the Cold War to the post-Cold War period, the increasing cases of upper tail dependence are China, Korea, Russia, and Ukraine while decreasing cases are Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.

There have been over four full-fledged armed conflicts, countless border skirmishes and cross-border ceasefire violations between these neighbouring countries. Their mutual relationships have often nosedived to a point where the nuclear conflagration seemed real possibility. While India is among the five largest military spenders in the world, Pakistan spends a disproportionately larger share of its GDP on defence to neutralize the Indian military advantage. While Pakistan's military expenditure is largely India-specific, it is not clear if the reverse is also true. Therefore, this study explores if the military expenditure of India and Pakistan are causally associated with each other or the arms race is asymmetric. Using the maximum entropy bootstrapping method and a series of robustness checks, we find that while military expenditure of Pakistan is shaped by the Indian military expenditure, the military expenditure in India is not Pakistan-specific. This study has important policy implications for the region because Pakistan may explore alternative strategic relationships with India.

In this essay, we argue that violence is overly monopolized in both conflicts. Firstly, Israel can safely ignore the peace process and renege on political concessions as long as Palestinians lack a credible militant threat. This threat, in turn, has been neutralized in large part by the Palestinian Authority (PA) itself, which has offered Israel increasingly effective security cooperation over the past decade. We argue that the PA’s decision to deepen security cooperation with Israel – in spite of its unpopularity among Palestinians – results from its own territorial monopolies on violence, which render it unaccountable to its constituents. Only by reintroducing a credible, latent threat of political-militant competitors to the PA will Palestinians be able to regain bargaining leverage over their own leadership, restore conditionality to their security cooperation with Israel, and put the peace process back on course.","Defence and Peace Economics","892-903","8","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1724398","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1724398","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:8:p:892-903","11",NA

The study argues that the economic liberalization reforms of the 1980s along with the subsequent Israel’s integration with the global economy are key drivers of the two groups’ opposing attitudes vis-à-vis the peace process. These processes benefited mainly the business classes, who are dominated by the Ashkenazim (originating from Europe). It was such benefit that drove Ashkenazim’s support for the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, which was seen as instrumental to the process of Israel’s integration with the global economy. Conversely, the same economic processes likely hurt lower-class members of Israeli Jewish society, most of whom are Mizrahim (originating from Muslim countries). In this context the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza provided them with an alternative source of welfare to buffer the negative impacts of the integration process. As a result most of the Mizrahim population opposed any peace deal that included the evacuation of settlements. Moreover, Mizrahim’s opposition to Oslo was strengthened by the association of Oslo with Israel’s global integration, which some evidence suggests mainly benefited the business classes.","Defence and Peace Economics","927-938","8","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1801159","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1801159","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:8:p:927-938","11",NA

The impact, at 1.5%, is much smaller if the endogeneity of piracy attacks is not controlled for. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that successful attacks, attacks that involve violence, or attacks that target cargo are particularly detrimental to trade. This paper contributes to the literature by being the first to look at: non-Somali piracy attacks, different commodity groups, and various forms of attacks. This paper also proposes the use of maritime distance, instead of the commonly used great-circle distance. Finally, it offers a new instrumental variable for piracy attacks, namely, the sum of the square of the highest security apparatus index among countries in the vicinity of each vital chokepoint crossed by a ship travelling on the shortest maritime trade route between a country-pair, in a given year.","Defence and Peace Economics","957-974","8","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1627511","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1627511","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:8:p:957-974","11",NA

Using time-series data spanning from 1980 to 2015, the findings from a linear specification in sanctions duration show no evidence to support the negative impact of sanctions on formal employment and poverty. The results, however, portray a quadratic relationship between sanctions duration and livelihoods. Sanctions reduced formal employment during the initial stages but the negative relationship changed over time. Subsequently, informality increased during the sanctions period. Similarly, the relationship between sanctions duration and poverty is also non-linear. The turning point of the poverty quadratic curve coincides with the implementation of indigenization policy. Indigenization policy magnified sanctions’ negative impact instead of offsetting the impact. In this view, the government should consider addressing the indigenization policy which it has control over while at the same time continue re-engaging USA for the removal of sanctions.","Defence and Peace Economics","1006-1020","8","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1661177","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1661177","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:8:p:1006-1020","11",NA

Answers to these questions fill an important gap in the literature by investigating the domestic constraints that influence a country’s response to questions of ‘burden-sharing’ and free riding within NATO. This study examines how citizens’ preferences respond to their domestic political environment, and whether this behavior aligns with the ‘guns versus butter’ trade-off. Findings from a multilevel model combining country-level data with survey data from 13 NATO member countries between 2004–2012 suggest that individuals who view NATO as essential are consistently more likely to support increases in military spending, but changes in the contextual environment, such as high levels of military spending or high levels of economic growth, alter the preferences of individuals in a manner that follows what is known about the trade-offs citizens make between ‘guns versus butter.’","Defence and Peace Economics","762-785","7","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1668236","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1668236","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:7:p:762-785","10",NA

Dependency creates an opportunity for an exporter to attempt to exert influence over the importer’s foreign and domestic policy. However, the arms trade is a trade and influence attempts to create economic costs for exporters by damaging relationships with current and potential customers. Thus, heavily dependent states do not necessarily need to change suppliers to avoid the threat. Additionally, as arms transfers are a signal of political support, dependency may be a sign of a mutually beneficial relationship rather than one that is potentially dangerous. This article evaluates these arguments using logistic regression models to evaluate changes in suppliers of major weapons systems. It finds that the relationship between dependence and arms transfers is more complex than previously argued where the nature of the relationship depends both on the type of exporter and the type of arm being exported.","Defence and Peace Economics","851-868","7","31","2020",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1618651","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1618651","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:31:y:2020:i:7:p:851-868","10",NA

The enactment of the National Defence Policy resulted in an increase in defence expenditure in Brazil that was primarily focused on developing and buying modern equipment and paying better salaries. The policy was implemented during three investment cycles that began with off-the-shelf acquisitions and moved to the execution of defence programmes aiming to develop indigenous technologies, substituting imports on the way.

We argue that dominance in modern warfare is enabled by human and technological intelligence that uncovers the rivals’ capabilities and intentions, increases the effectiveness of the country’s own weapon systems, and facilitates the development of high-quality defense systems. Hence, gathering and evaluating intelligence is essential for countries involved in conflict or exposed to terror threats. We focus here on the strategic and tactical implications of intelligence in the context of an arms and intelligence race between two rivals. We present and assess models that show how security agencies in countries in a state of conflict (with other countries and/or non-country entities) should invest in developing their own intelligence capabilities to ensure adequate military (security) capabilities, national security, and welfare. Since advanced cyber attackers can infiltrate almost all complex computer networks to gather intelligence (and/or cause other harms), we show how countries can establish procedures and determine the budgets to optimally allocate cyber-defense resources to prevent harmful cyber-attacks on the complex computer networks that manage their infrastructure, business, security, and government operations.","Defence and Peace Economics","18-45","1","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1778966","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1778966","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:1:p:18-45","01",NA

In particular, we exploit three different measures of military expenditures: (i) military spending in absolute terms; (ii) military expenditures per capita; (iii) military burden, namely the ratio between military expenditure and GDP. Findings highlight a positive relationship between military expenditures and income inequality captured by means of three different measures of inequality. Results are also confirmed after we performed a variety of robustness tests. Other results are worth noting and somehow puzzling. For example, military conscription appears to have a redistributional effect and when considering a non-linearity the results show that there could be a concave relationship between military spending and income inequality.

This result greatly adds to the debate about the type of military-recruitment system countries should implement: abolishing compulsory military service is usually seen as increasing efficiency and performance; yet, a positive – and previously unknown – externality of conscription that we identify is a higher degree of support by the public, which is pivotal for, inter alia, defense-policy implementation, military interventions abroad, budget considerations, or the participation in military alliances.","Defence and Peace Economics","240-251","2","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1709031","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1709031","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:2:p:240-251","02",NA

The findings display a high probability of technological risks followed by contractual risks as the cause for delays in Indian defence procurement. Technological risks are concentrated in cases of indigenous procurement due to a lack of infrastructure and resources while contractual risks mostly occur in contracts where the Ministry of Defence deals with external agents like foreign suppliers.

Turkey presents an interesting case for analysis of military spending and economic growth, as its geopolitical position and history of insurgencies and separatist violence oblige the country to devote an unusually large share of the central government budget to national defence. Timescale regression analysis reveals that military expenditures have significant negative effects on growth in per capita GDP at business cycles of 16 years and longer. Timescale Granger causality analysis indicates that per capita GDP growth responds to movements in military expenditures at business cycles of eight years and above and that this result is very significant.

We resort to various wavelet coherence methods to capture the influence of geopolitical risk on the dynamic association between oil and stock prices in Saudi Arabia as a rich oil-exporting country in a region with high geopolitical risk. We primarily show that the role of geopolitical risk in the oil-stock interplay varies through timescales and investment horizons. News regarding geopolitical tensions affects the stock market in high frequency bands, while oil impacts are manifested more on longer time-horizons. Geopolitical risk weakens oil-stock connectedness in the short term. Interestingly, geopolitical incidents significantly lower the oil-stock magnitude and volatility correlation.

According to DaVanzo’s theory of repeat migration, this military-motivated migration might foster post-military migration. This paper investigates this issue empirically using individual-level data drawn from the 1992, 1998, and 2001 editions of the French survey of labor market entrants ‘Génération.’ The methods used to identify the causal effect of compulsory peacetime conscription on the post-military propensity to migrate exploit the abolition of conscription in France in October 1997 plus information on the timing of service among those who served. Conscription stimulated the post-military propensity to migrate for work of French male labor-market entrants with upper-class origins. Furthermore, there is evidence of a previously overlooked anticipatory effect of conscription: French males who were waiting to be called up for military service were approximately 25% less likely to migrate for work than comparable non-conscripts. Some implications of these findings and a consideration of their external validity are also provided.","Defence and Peace Economics","489-506","4","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1660475","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1660475","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:4:p:489-506","05",NA

Large-Scale Land Acquisitions and Conflict Events in Sub-Saharan Africa","The paper provides evidence that large-scale land acquisitions in Sub-Saharan Africa raise the likelihood of experiencing outbursts of organized violence. This evidence is achieved through a spatially disaggregated approach, to account for local characteristics, and a quasi-experimental research design, implemented to overcome limitations due to missing geo-referenced information about land deals. Domestic acquisitions are particularly significant in explaining organized violence outbreak, suggesting that the national concentration of power among economic elites hinder social stability. Further, the institutional framework, which forms the background for LSLAs, is a prominent determinant of organized violence occurrence. In particular, more egalitarian and inclusive societies are less prone to conflicts, even in the presence of LSLAs. When land deals are finalized to the cultivation of agricultural commodities for biofuels, the effect is less evident and violence partially depends on climate conditions. On the other hand, land deals still in implementation stage seem to narrow organized violence, possibly due to both local control of areas under investments and socio-economic effects of the deals. Results also show the existence of significant spatio-temporal dependence path, since events of organized violence tend to be recurrent and to persist in space, feeding ‘neighbouring’ effects of proximity and local patterns of violence concentration.","Defence and Peace Economics","427-450","4","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1647727","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1647727","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:4:p:427-450","05",NA

From the Perspective of Geopolitical Risk","This paper investigates the political property of oil from the perspective of geopolitical risk (GPR). We explore the relationship between GPR and oil price (OP) by performing the full-sample and subsample rolling-window bootstrap Granger causality tests. We find that wars will lead to an increase in OP but that low GPR cannot lead to an immediate decline in price. This finding can also be explained by economic crises, which can make OP soar while GPR is low. In turn, the rise in OP has a positive impact on GPR. The oil market has a significant interaction with geopolitical events, which reflects the pattern of global politics, so we can conclude that oil has a political property. In the context of a tense and complex global relationship, the world can benefit from the political property of oil to prevent GPR, which can in turn facilitate an accurate prediction of OP to reduce the adverse effects of large fluctuations in the oil market.","Defence and Peace Economics","451-467","4","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1708562","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1708562","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:4:p:451-467","05",NA

Second, the unconditional impact of regime durability was also positive on terrorism with the exception of uncertain terrorism but in a rather inconsistent manner. Third, the interactions between democracy and regime durability are found to have positive marginal effects on all the terrorism types except uncertain terrorism. Fourth, the net effects of interaction between democracy and regime durability are positive across various models of these terrorism measures.

The empirical results of pooled mean group estimators suggest that military expenditure generally increases the external debt burden in the studied countries. More specifically, it was noted that military expenditure decreases external debt in Europe and Central Asia. Moreover, it was found that the interaction term of military expenditure and growth rate is positive and significant in all of the sub-samples, except upper-middle class, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin American regions. Thus, it may be concluded that military expenditure often increases external debt burden in countries where the debt management system is weak.

This paper examines the effects of national economic and socio-economic factors on national peace level, and on the corresponding elementary indicators. The empirical analysis is implemented through a panel dataset, using different econometric methodologies. The basic results underline that countries characterized by higher economic development levels, open trade systems, more educated population, and democratic systems rest on higher national peace levels. Meanwhile, countries that experience higher levels of income inequality and that are endowed with natural resources tend to be less peaceful. Also, the positive impacts of international alliances/regional blocs on national peace are mainly expressed through their promoting economic effects rather than through their aggression-deterrence properties. The empirical analysis shows that the effects of national economic and socio-economic factors on the elementary indicators exhibit considerable variations in magnitude and significance. Hence, an exclusive examination of the effects of these variables on the overall peace index would conceal significant differences across the elementary indicators, which should be accounted for when analyzing national peace and developing peace-promoting strategies.","Defence and Peace Economics","509-532","5","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1743957","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1743957","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:5:p:509-532","07",NA

As debate continues over the mechanisms underlying the relationship between economic development and civil war, this paper scrutinizes the indicator of GDP directly, disaggregating it into its constituent components to examine whether their distinct associations with conflict onset can shed some light into the black box. Analysis of the individual correlations allows for identification of the driving force behind the aggregate statistical relationship. With this information to hand, consistency checks can be made with existing theories and a new theory presented in this paper, which draws attention to a critical structural factor that drives the supply of civil war labor, namely the lack of consumption opportunities. This factor increases the likelihood of civil war in less economically developed countries as individuals with low consumption opportunities have little to lose from reordering the economic and political system. Analysis of the correlations between components of GDP and the onset of civil war shows that this new theory is most consistent with the key drivers of the aggregate relationship. The examination also highlights a new indicator, which is arguably preferable to GDP as a measure of this relationship.","Defence and Peace Economics","533-549","5","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2019.1703441","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2019.1703441","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:5:p:533-549","07",NA

Under what circumstances do rebel groups target Americans? To answer these questions, we leverage the Big Allied And Dangerous 2 data – Insurgency subsample (BAAD2-I). Our model focuses on two classes of rebel motives: direct and indirect. Direct motives are those in which Americans play a central role in rebel group grievances. They include ideology, deployment of American troops, and American support for rebels’ government-based opponents. Indirect motives are those that encourage anti-American attacks because of their powerful symbolic value. This distinction speaks to ongoing policy debates within the United States about the most effective policy instruments to defeat extremism abroad. Contrary to common perceptions, we find that attacks on Americans are unrelated to group ideology. Instead, deployment of American troops and military assistance is positively associated with attacks on Americans, as is economic penetration. Conversely, rebel groups in countries with substantial exports to the US or featuring a long-term presence of American cultural artifacts are less likely to attack Americans.

This finding is robust to an instrumental-variable approach and further robustness checks. We argue that class cleavages – in the form of the monopolization of political power by the rich – perpetuated and exacerbated the socio-economic ordeal of the poor, while simultaneously curtailing their means to effect relief in the ordinary political process. Consistent with our expectations, this provoked terrorist violence by groups whose ideological orientation highlighted concerns over class conflict, economic equality and the political participation of the poor. Indeed, our empirical analysis also shows that terrorist groups motivated by other ideologies (e.g. extreme nationalism) did not respond to political exclusion of the poor in the same manner, which further emphasizes the role of ideological inclinations in the terrorist response to class antagonisms.","Defence and Peace Economics","681-697","6","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1940456","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1940456","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:6:p:681-697","08",NA

In this paper, we theorize dyadic strategic choices and interactions between governments and domestic terrorist groups in times of economic turmoil. We contend that governments are more likely to increase their targeting of domestic terrorist groups, which provides legitimate opportunities to divert public attention from economic concerns and rally individuals around the flag. Meanwhile, observing such incentives, domestic terrorist groups make strategic decisions similar to those of interstate actors by either decreasing their attacks (strategic conflict avoidance) or increasing them (strategic conflict seeking) to add an inability to provide safety and security to the government’s existing struggles. We test these competing hypotheses by leveraging two recently released event datasets focusing on the Turkey-PKK conflict.

A growing body of literature seeks to understand political violence by looking at cooperative and competitive relationships among non-state actors.

By employing the fixed effect panel threshold regression approach, we unveil the non-linear relationship between military spending and external indebtedness, which has not been examined for the selected twelve transition economies over the period from 1997 to 2016. Our findings reveal the presence of double threshold effects that are embedded in military expenditure, and the debt-accelerating effect of military spending emerges after the first regime.

Recent Developments and Market Concentration in the European Armoured Vehicle Industry","Despite considerable restructuring since the end of the Cold War, the European armoured vehicle industry remains largely fragmented along national lines. As stagnating domestic budgets, rising R&D and production costs and the limits of export-focused industrial strategies provide an economic imperative for further consolidation, the merger of Nexter and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in 2015 has often been regarded as a mere starting point for a wider trans-European reorganisation process which could even result in a land-based equivalent to Airbus. This article proposes a new classification system to identify the ‘prime competitors’ of the European armoured vehicle industry and debates prospects for further consolidation among them. By means of a volume-based variant of the HHI, concentration in European procurement of armoured vehicles is estimated and various merger simulations are conducted. The results suggest that, while the European armoured vehicle industry will likely experience further consolidation, this process will probably be too small in scope to create an ‘Airbus of the land systems sector’. In the medium to long term, however, market pressures and collaborative programmes such as the Main Ground Combat System might have the potential to create a ‘European champion’ in selected subsectors of the armoured vehicle industry.","Defence and Peace Economics","800-828","7","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1751502","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1751502","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:7:p:800-828","10",NA

Accordingly, affordability has become a more discussed subject in defence acquisition. This paper addresses the process of generating complex defence equipment concepts. The purpose is to explore how affordability is managed in that process and to identify possible leads to how an unsustainable cost escalation for this type of equipment can be curbed. This is done by studying two cases of concept generation of future combat air equipment systems from a company process perspective. This applied micro perspective on cost escalation showed that none of the concepts generated in these two cases were assessed to curb the cost escalation. Further, the innovation model for the generated concepts, with only one notable exception, was incremental. Nevertheless, the empirical observations from these two cases offer leads on how to potentially foster a more innovative and affordability-oriented concept generation process for future defence equipment, as well as indicating avenues for future research.","Defence and Peace Economics","847-863","7","32","2021",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1733896","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1733896","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:32:y:2021:i:7:p:847-863","10",NA

The use of political vicinity matrices reveals a negative eﬀect of allied relations on defense burdens, which supports the free-riding theory in alliances for setting a defense budget.

This way of waging war entails the synchronized use of a broad spectrum of instruments that are well-designed to stay below the thresholds of detection, attribution and retaliation. Combining these (relatively cheap) threats with conventional military hard power confronts the liberal democracies with a difficult choice in terms of defence budget allocation. Whereas arms race stability in the conventional and nuclear domain leads to a peaceful stalemate, this article demonstrates that adding hybrid threats to the spectrum of state power projection leads to a gradual shift of the power balance. While hybrid threats have been extensively studied within the international relations literature, we are (to the best of our knowledge) the first to study these changing security paradigms from a defence economic point of view. Moreover, this article is the first to represent this increasingly complicated state power competition in a game theoretic framework.","Defence and Peace Economics","26-41","1","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1875289","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1875289","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:1:p:26-41","01",NA

The results highlight the causality running from GPR to DE in China, India, and Saudi Arabia. In other words, the GPR in the form of border disputes, wars and terrorism threats can pursuade countries to increase their defence expenditure. The results we obtain for these three countries are also supported by the neoclassical model, which asserts that GPR is a significant contributor to DE. Contrary to above, there are evidences for reverse causality as well where DE is causing GPR in South Korea and Turkey. The most probable reasons for reverse causality could be the various alliances for regional security by the countries and their dependency on the import of military equipment. The results indicate an insignificant relationship between GPR and DE in Brazil, Israel, and Russia; where the DE is mainly determined by the internal political system and its contribution towards employment generation. On the basis of our results, it can be inferred that the convergence of regional interests in the form of a peaceful solution of disputes may guarantee security. Also, the formulation of the policies that are independent and isolated from the influence of external powers, can help in controlling the ever-increasing DE and GPR in these countries.","Defence and Peace Economics","42-58","1","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1802836","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1802836","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:1:p:42-58","01",NA

Foley’s model is extremely useful for examining the relationship between military spending and the rates of profit as it allows one to specify the parameters in both the military and civilian sectors. By incorporating the military sector, the adapted model shows that a larger military sector is associated with a higher rate of profit.

Then it statistically explores factors that affect how frequently these countries test-launch their missiles. In that regard, three broad possibilities are investigated: (i) increases in missile tests following decisions to upgrade the missile arsenal or missile-dependent technologies, (ii) increases in missile tests as a retaliation to foreign military threats, and (iii) decreases in missile tests due to economic costs introduced by sanctions. Negative Binomial regression analyses suggest that decisions to upgrade missile and missile-dependent technologies increase all missile tests but have no consistent effect on publicized missile tests. Threats of military nature have surprisingly no consistent effect on all or publicized missile tests. However, receiving economic sanctions increase publicized missile tests.

This policy issue is especially of importance for developing countries as the decision to finance the acquisition of arms using agricultural taxes will create a trade-off between two important policy objectives in these countries: on the one hand, ensuring food security for the population at large and, on the other hand, improving national security. Our empirical findings generally suggest that governments in developing countries partly finance their arms imports by increasing the agricultural tax rate. It turns out that the magnitude of this effect relies to a certain extent on country-specific factors such as whether a country has to deal with a security threat, strength of the democratic institutions in place, and the regular occurrence of major shocks to the domestic food provision. Also, taxes on cash crops intended for export are more likely to be used for financing the arms imports compared to taxes on import-competing or subsistence crops.","Defence and Peace Economics","177-200","2","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1844401","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1844401","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:2:p:177-200","02",NA

State Chance Game Participation in Turkey","Net profits of state-run chance games are either earmarked for non-defence ‘good causes’ or added to the public purse in international practice. The Turkish case is unique as 95% of profits were earmarked for the extrabudgetary Defence Industry Support Fund (DISF) by legislation during 1986–2007. The DISF administers security equipment procurement and domestic arms production in Turkey. The earmarking practice was dissolved in 2007 and chance game profits are transferred to the general budget. The incomings of the DISF are from the budget and from earmarked taxes from 2007 onwards. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of these practices on chance game sales for the period 1986–2017. Noting that a chance game is a joint public-private good, participation is motivated by expectations for private gain but at the same time loss is legitimised by expectations for provision of public services with the takeout part. In order to gain insight into the societal motives in chance game participation in Turkey our model is defined in the context of private (consumerism) cum public (security, warfare) interest. The VECM estimates support a long-run relationship between chance game sales and security variables.","Defence and Peace Economics","162-176","2","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1832395","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1832395","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:2:p:162-176","02",NA

I find a sizable negative effect of the joint treatment. The average Iranian lost an accumulated sum of approximately US$ 34,660 during 1978–1988 (i.e. the average annual real per capita income loss of US$ 3,150). This loss equals 40% of the real income per capita, which an Iranian could earn in the absence of revolution and war.

However, with the end of the Colonial War and Portugal’s entry into Democracy, there was a clear shift in this pattern. Since 1975, military expenditure has ceased to be the most important sector of the Portuguese State, and currently plays only a very reduced role, while social spending has today supplanted it as the most significant sector. Through the estimation of a dynamic model, it proved possible to identify some of the positive and negative effects of military spending on the Portuguese economy during the period 1874–2018.

Using a panel data instrumental variable approach, we find that greater fiscal capacity robustly raises social spending in developing countries in the period 1990 to 2010. It is also strongly evident that rising democratisation enhances social sector spending; the presence of greater democracy and higher fiscal capacity could reinforce this effect.

However, the costs per flying hour frequently used to compare unmanned and manned aircraft only cover variable costs of aircraft operation. Variable costs per flying hour may overstate UASs’ cost advantage because they do not account for UASs having shorter life spans and being destroyed at higher rates than manned aircraft. In this note, we develop a lifecycle cost per flying hour that considers both acquisition and recurring costs while also accounting for UASs having shorter life spans and greater accidental destruction rates than manned aircraft. We compare unmanned United States Air Force RQ-4 to manned United States Navy P-8 costs using our methodology. While the RQ-4 has a variable cost per flying hour about 38% less than the P-8’s, we find that the RQ-4’s lifecycle cost per flying hour is about 17% less than the P-8’s.","Defence and Peace Economics","496-500","4","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1969187","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1969187","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:4:p:496-500","05",NA

The article focuses on Sweden’s declared three essential security interests – combat aircraft capability; underwater capabilities; and integrity-critical parts of the command, control, communication and intelligence domain (C3I). The article finds that the possibilities and ways forward for the essential security interests vary, with a general trend towards more shared and increasingly partial autonomy. Six change factors are formulated as drivers towards Sweden’s partial strategic autonomy of today: Autonomy as a result of failed internationalization; Techno-nationalist perception of Sweden leading to industrial protectionism; Strategic choice; Corporate lobbying; Export incentives leading to political support of technologies; and Europeanization of the EU defence industry. Techno-nationalism and strategic choice are the factors with the most evident impact. The overall governance of the defence industry is clear on the priority of ensuring security of supply and a high degree of autonomy regarding the three essential security interests. Other parts of the defence industry operate under globalized and more competitive conditions. In order to apply increased economic rationality and strive for shared autonomy, Sweden must increase its engagement in multilateral arms collaboration.","Defence and Peace Economics","399-420","4","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1992713","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1992713","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:4:p:399-420","05",NA

The main finding is that low civilian employment rates at the local level tend to increase the mean IQ score of those who volunteer for military service, whereas the opposite is true if employment rates in the civilian labour market move in a more favourable direction.

We conclude that the earlier management reforms served as instruments to reduce defence expenditure and that the reforms have affected how agencies and the Government interact and how politicians are able to influence the sector. Furthermore, there are indications that these reforms have contributed to the management challenges we can observe in the defence sector today.

This has in recent years put the debate on burden sharing within the Alliance in the limelight. Within the Alliance, the interpretation of the guidelines is different. This is partly because the U.S.A, especially under President Trump, has consistently viewed the 2-% guideline as a binding agreement. Some allies have, however, indicated that their military expenditure will not increase to the recommended threshold by the set deadline. Critics of the guideline have also identified several shortfalls associated with it and consequently dismissed it. Those who support it emphasize for instance that it contributes to addressing grievances about free riding within the Alliance. This paper contributes to this discussion and literature on demand for military expenditure by assessing how NATO’s two percent guideline can be viewed from a demand for military expenditure perspective. It also proposes and estimates a dynamic panel model for this purpose. Empirical evidence presented suggests that fiscal conditions require attention in the debate on the two percent guideline.","Defence and Peace Economics","475-488","4","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1940649","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1940649","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:4:p:475-488","05",NA

And yet, after decades of research, this domestic-centered approach has yet to identify any particular set of institutions or policies that explain variation in innovative performance over time and across cases. Recently, a new research program has emerged which argues that this bottleneck to theory development is due to a critical omitted variable bias: international security. This article probes one facet of this argument by examining the relationship between international threat environments and national innovation rates. The regression results show a positive effect of threats on national innovation, a finding that is robust across different specifications and periods of analysis. Additionally, unlike previous studies that find no significant relationship between security alliances and military innovation, the opposite is true of threat: states faced with high external threat environments tend to innovate at the defense technology frontier.","Defence and Peace Economics","563-584","5","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2020.1853984","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2020.1853984","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:5:p:563-584","07",NA

That analysis is further bolstered by propensity-score matching to ameliorate potential selection bias stemming from non-UN PKOs. For the matched sample, we find that non-UN peacebuilding and peace enforcement missions limit rebel caused OSV, which is a novel result. Second, the ability of non-UN PKOs’ troops and police to end conflict or to maintain peace are ascertained based on survival analysis. Non-UN troops, but not police, curtail the transition from peace, regardless of matching.

The main findings presented in this study clearly demonstrate that the uncertainty surrounding the deal caused a significant drop in the daily return on the equity prices of US defense firms. This result suggests that investors believe that it is very likely that the major arms deal will be blocked by Congress in the short-run thereby reducing the business perspectives of the US defense-related industry.

The results of the analysis indicate that the threat posed by Russia provided the most important incentive for increasing defence budgets. However, general budget constraints kept some allies from increasing their defence budget in proportion to the threat posed by Russia. Conversely, in the absence of budget constraints, allies governed by a right-leaning executive made intermediate budget efforts even if they only faced a low level of threat. Strikingly, budget inertia only had a modest impact on the allies’ defence budgets, only resulting in a low level of spending in allies that were not threatened by Russia and either faced considerable budget constraints or were governed by a left-wing government.","Defence and Peace Economics","637-654","6","33","2022",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1928435","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1928435","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:33:y:2022:i:6:p:637-654","08","GDPE_A_1928435_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20220823T191300 git hash: 39867e6e2f"

We present a novel approach to study the effect of military build-ups on dispute intensity, using monthly data on Turkish incursions into Greek-claimed airspace. Because airspace claims feature strongly in the dispute, these contestations represent an appropriate measure of the intensity with which Turkey pursues the conflict. Theoretically, we suggest that bilateral factors drive this intensity. We argue that increased Greek military capabilities deter incursions whereas increased Turkish military capabilities fuel them.

A Computable General Equilibrium Model is used as a tool to examine these effects, allowing potential sector details and the identification of distributional implications. The results suggest that when no mitigation policies are undertaken, the downsizing process has a small regional effect on GDP but a greater local effect on the island. Imports, as expected, tend to decrease in the cutback scenarios and to increase when specific mitigation policies are considered. The main export gainers are the primary sectors that become more competitive due to factor price decreases. The main export losers are some industrialized products and services. The results provide support for the implementation of mitigation policies, which should be reasonable in both their intensity and focus, since there is a risk associated with these policies.

This project summarizes the core logic of the two models, compares and contrasts their assumptions, and derives a set of hypotheses about the implementation of peace agreements. These hypotheses are tested using data from the Peace Accords Matrix. The empirical findings indicate that increases in military capacity are associated with lower levels of peace agreement implementation. However, increases in state capacity related to the rule of law are associated with higher levels of implementation. The starting level of coercive and administrative capacity appears to be uncorrelated with the degree to which peace agreements are implemented. This finding points to a possible early warning for peace agreement breakdown. Likewise, it suggests that state building may be less a driver of post-conflict success than it is a manifestation of the preferences of key actors.","Defence and Peace Economics","112-127","1","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1946894","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1946894","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:1:p:112-127","01","GDPE_A_1946894_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20220907T060133 git hash: 85d61bd949"

In so doing, it is demonstrated that no Congressional constrain exists in this regard; the President rarely seeks ex ante authorization for the use of force and is therefore not truly constrained in its use. In fact, evidence is brought to bear that if anything the diversionary theory of war initiation may hold water; inflation is shown herein to be negatively linked to ex ante Congressional authorization for the use of force. It seems as though the President is less likely to ask Congress for permission to conduct deadly military operations when inflation is high.","Defence and Peace Economics","1-12","1","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.2001620","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.2001620","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:1:p:1-12","01","GDPE_A_2001620_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20220907T060133 git hash: 85d61bd949"

We present a conflict-theoretic model to analyze two adversaries’ endogenous arming decisions when they separately establish a free trade agreement (FTA) with a neutral third-party state. We contrast this multiple FTAs regime with a single FTA regime between one adversary and the third-party state, which excludes the other adversary as a non-member. In our analysis, the benchmark case is a protectionist regime when the bilateral trade between the third-party state and each of the adversaries is a tariff war. Among the three trade regimes, we show that the two adversaries’ aggregate arming is the lowest under multiple FTAs but is the highest under a single FTA. These results suggest that, despite no trade between two adversary countries, multiple FTAs through third-party trade have the pacifying or appeasing effect of lowering overall military buildups in interstate conflicts.","Defence and Peace Economics","160-182","2","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1949830","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1949830","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:2:p:160-182","02","GDPE_A_1949830_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

Under which circumstances, then, does the disadvantaged side give in rather than attempting to fight? And what explains variation in effort levels by strong states? I present a model of an environment in which a strong state faces political pressure to replace the losing government following a costly war. I show that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the effort the winning state devotes to the war and the probability that the losing state surrenders – when war effort is low, the weaker state fights because it has a decent chance of winning; when it is high, the weak state fights because it recognizes that it will be replaced upon surrender.

This paper employs the Instrumental Variable approach and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition in an intergenerational regression model. When controlling parental schooling, household income and size, religion, and gender, the results show that children from the Deep South obtain almost one year less schooling than children from the rest of the Southern region. Interestingly, Muslims are ahead in terms of educational attainment when compared to non-Muslims in the non-conflict region, but not in the conflict region. Females outperform males in both regions, but the coefficient of female dummy is higher in the non-conflict region. Moreover, the rate of intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is higher in the Deep South compared to that in the rest of the southern region, which may lead to long-term educational inequality in the Deep South region. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition confirms that the 40% schooling gap between these two regions is unexplained but might be due to the chronic social unrest.

As the burden sharing literature currently lacks notions of hybrid threats, we believe the current modelling to be ill-suited to provide reliable assessments of member states’ burden sharing behaviour. We address this void by adjusting the Joint Product Model, extending a country’s security activities to a more inclusive ‘whole of government (WoG) approach’. We depart from this WoG model to stress the challenges associated with comparing the contributions of member states in countering these threats. This leads us to dispute the use of aggregate military expenditures as a main variable to measure a country’s degree of free riding. More and other types of (non-military) variables and proxy-indexes should be taken into account.

Before the pandemic, the Norwegian government had planned to gradually increase the number of personnel in the armed forces. Hence, an expedited recruitment strategy may improve welfare. We calculate the costs and benefits to Norwegian society of a strategy that exploits the hike in unemployment rates to recruit new personnel to the armed forces at a faster rate. We find that the expedited recruitment strategy will likely provide net benefits to society if the unemployed have a fair chance of being employed.

This leads to the prediction that when groups expect the absence of an enforcement mechanism, the stronger group makes a larger concession, while the weaker group makes a more demanding offer, than would be expected according to the relative power dynamic between groups. On the other hand, when groups expect that a third-party peace operator will enforce an agreement, groups’ offers more closely reflect their relative power situation.

One reason for the focus on aggregate spending is the lack of disaggregated cross-country data, but there are some data available from NATO and the EU that break military spending into personnel, equipment, infrastructure and other expenditures (primarily operations and maintenance). This paper uses these data, available for 34 countries, for as many as 49 years, to investigate whether the composition of military budgets affects economic growth. Estimating standard growth models with this data it finds that as expected there is considerable heterogeneity in the effects of the different components.

First, is the UK aircraft industry a decreasing cost industry; second, are new entrants higher cost suppliers; third, what is the evidence on profitability in war and peace and between new entrants and original developers; fourth, what is the UK evidence on Augustine-type cost escalation and on the efficiency of aircraft procurement in war and peace? The UK aircraft industry was found to be a decreasing cost industry reflecting both scale and learning economies. Typically, new entrants were higher cost suppliers and profit rates were higher in peace-time. There was substantial Augustine cost escalation for UK combat aircraft and doubts are raised about the efficiency of military aircraft procurement.","Defence and Peace Economics","512-526","4","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2051953","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2051953","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:4:p:512-526","05","GDPE_A_2051953_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

To this end, we employ the synthetic control methodology, and estimate the missing counterfactual scenario for the long-run growth and development of former Yugoslav republics, in the absence of the civil war by matching their growth and development characteristics with non-Yugoslav countries at the similar stages of development. The results suggest that the civil war led to unprecedented long-run growth and development losses. In the absence of the war, per capita income levels of former Yugoslav republics would improve markedly with notable differences in the magnitude of the growth and development gains across the affected countries. The estimated effects of the civil war are robust to a large number of placebo checks, and falsification-based random permutation tests. The results show that not a single former Yugoslav republic down to the present day has achieved the level of per capita income predicted by their synthetic control groups in the years preceding the civil war.

This paper focuses on a new dimension and seeks to answer if the US major macroeconomic indicators affect the international geopolitical risk (GPR). Based on our knowledge, there is no such study conducted so far, and thus, we propose to fill this gap. We constructed a theoretical framework and estimated an econometric model using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag methodology and quarterly data (1973–2020). The results show a statistically significant effect of the US macroeconomic variables on the GPR. The long-run results are decisive and unique, while the short-run influences are mixed in significance levels and signs. Hence, the short-run impact may differ over time and its final impact depends on the outweighing effect between the harmful and beneficial outcomes. The findings prove that a dominant country with economic and political powers can influence the GPR. From a policy implication side, we affirm that globalization should proceed side by side with cooperation and coordination among nations to solve economic glitches. Otherwise, geopolitical risk will make the economic performance worse.","Defence and Peace Economics","495-511","4","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2034103","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2034103","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:4:p:495-511","05","GDPE_A_2034103_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

For this purpose, Panel Smooth Transition Regression, PSTR, models are estimated not only for all countries’ sample but also for low income, middle income, and high-income countries’ subsamples to reveal possible distinct asymmetric relationships for country groups with different income levels. Empirical results for the whole sample, low income and middle income groups indicate that military expenditure not only governs the regime change, but also low and high levels of military expenditure have distinctive and rising negative effects on economic growth with dissimilar threshold effects. Moreover, empirical findings also indicate that net arms exports govern regime change for high income countries, and as net arms exports rise, the negative impacts of military expenditure on economic growth become deeper.","Defence and Peace Economics","477-494","4","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2021.1984030","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2021.1984030","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:4:p:477-494","05","GDPE_A_1984030_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

One possible remedy is to promote information and communication technology (ICT), which may cause the anti-corruption policies to become more effective in increasing transparency for the public and reducing unnecessary and abusive military spending. This study discusses the nexus among corruption, military spending, and ICT with a panel data of 48 SSA countries from 2003 to 2015. Our analysis reveals that when ICT prevails, military spending is negatively associated with the control of corruption, so that anti-corruption policies with the usage of ICT could reduce the extravagant budget allocation to military spending. Policymakers should associate sound ICT policy with traditional anti-corruption factors to bring more transparency and less corrupt behaviors in the military department.

True Colour Composite images, produced from Sentinel satellite imagery show that smallholder irrigation schemes were operational. There was a shift from commercial crops to cereals. The situation in western Tigray was particular, as there has been ethnic cleansing of the population and often the 2020 rainfed crops had even not been harvested. Overall, our findings show that the Tigrayan smallholder farming system is resilient, thanks to community self-organisation, combining common strategies of agrarian societies in wartime: spatio-temporal shift in agricultural activities to avoid the proximity with soldiers and shifts in crop types.

Building on psychological theories incorporating the role of emotion in decision-making, we designed a before-and-after-mission survey for Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2011. Our hypothesis of an effect from A.F.E.s is tested by controlling for other mechanisms that may also change preferences: immediate emotion, trauma effect – proxied by post-traumatic stress disorder (P.T.S.D.) – and changes in wealth and risk perception. At the aggregate level, results show stable preferences before and after mission. We find positive A.F.E.s for all three emotions studied (fear, anxiety and excitement), with anticipated emotions stronger than those actually experienced. We provide evidence that positive A.F.E.s regarding fear significantly increase risk tolerance and impatience, while positive A.F.E.s regarding excitement strengthen the will to stay in the military.

Firstly, while most studies argue that democratic political institutions constrain the incumbents’ power to allocate resources to the military, there is still disagreement about which institution. Second, empirical evidence on causality is very scarce. Endogeneity remains a difficult problem to grapple with. To address these issues, I specify a clear set of channels of interaction linking democratic political institutions to military spending. Following previous work, I also argue that political accountability constrains allocations to the military. However, I distinguish three types of accountability: horizontal, vertical and diagonal. I find that diagonal accountability is the strongest mechanism. Furthermore, I use a country’s accumulated experience with political accountability as an instrumental variable to tackle the endogeneity between political accountability and military spending.

Cyber-attacks aim to disrupt, block, delete, manipulate or steal the data held in these networks, which challenge these countries’ national security. Consequently, cybersecurity programs must be developed to protect these networks from cyber-attacks in a manner that is similar to operations against terrorism. This study presents several models that analyze a contest between a network operator (defender) that deploys costly detectors to protect the network and a capable cyber attacker. Generally, when the deployed detectors become more potent or the defender exhibits higher vigilance, the attacker allocates more resources to R&D to ensure that the attack remains covert. We show that detectors may be substitutes, complements, or even degrade each other, implying that defenders must account for the cyber weapons’ characteristics and the attacker’s profile and strategic behavior. We derive the optimal number of detectors when the attacker’s R&D process features R&D spillovers and show that targeted detectors act as deterrents against high-quality weapons only if the attacker’s budget is not substantial. Finally, we demonstrate that common cybersecurity practices may be detrimental from a social-welfare perspective by enhancing an arms race with the attacker.","Defence and Peace Economics","726-746","6","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2161739","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2161739","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:6:p:726-746","08","GDPE_A_2161739_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

This paper attempts to fill in this gap and aims to explore the impact of these two forces acting in conjunction with each other on a conflict situation. In fact, we also endogenise the intervention decision of the third party and explore parametric restrictions under which a third party decides to intervene (either as an ally of one of the conflicting parties or as an ‘idealist’ aiming to reduce overall conflict levels) and its repercussions on associated conflict levels. We also present narrative evidences of some real-life conflicts that amply exhibit the two forces of third-party intervention and revenge.Peace is the only battle worth waging. – Albert Camus","Defence and Peace Economics","767-790","6","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2065187","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2065187","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:6:p:767-790","08","GDPE_A_2065187_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

To this end, we estimate a theoretically consistent structural gravity equation which accounts for several well-known estimation biases such as ‘home bias’, endogeneity and multilateral resistance. This specification makes it possible to identify the effect of a country-specific time-varying characteristic such as terrorism on bilateral foreign direct investment. We exploit a dataset that covers domestic and foreign investment of 182 countries in the period 2006-2016 on both the extensive and intensive margins. Our study finds that foreign investors are reluctant to invest in countries affected by terrorism and also reduce the amount of their investments in such cases. Sensitivity to terrorism is higher for foreign than for domestic investors. Terrorist attacks have a more intense impact on foreign investors’ decision-making when they are international or when these violent acts hurt governments. However, our results also evidence that good governance appears to be an effective tool for counterbalancing these damages in the eyes of foreign investors.","Defence and Peace Economics","827-844","6","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2067812","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2067812","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:6:p:827-844","08","GDPE_A_2067812_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

Regional democracy, bilateral trade, and trade openness slow down the process where states go to war. This paper hypothesizes that key factors raise the temperature of disputes, increasing the likelihood of a political dispute combusting to war, while other attributes inhibit the process to war. Economic growth catalyzes such reactions, while regional and joint democracy impede the probability that a war sparks.

The results show that the overall impact of North Korean provocations on South Korea’s short-run economic growth is negligible. Since inter-Korean relations have gone through four phases, this paper also estimates the impact of provocations over each subperiod. Provocations had a significant impact on South Korea’s economic growth during 1960-1970 and 1992-1997 when inter-Korean tensions were high, but the effects took on different signs. While provocations decreased South Korea’s economic growth during 1992-1997, it had a positive impact on South Korea’s macroeconomy before 1970.

This study examines one such aspect, namely the economic spillover of sanctions to neighboring countries. Our global vector autoregression oil and inventory model (GOVAR) simulations on Indonesia, a medium-level oil producer, indicate sanctions may spill over to its neighbors’ domestic economy. The risk and nature of spillover varies with respect to the type of sanctions employed, timing of sanctions, and the macroeconomic indicator in the neighboring state in question. Equity markets appear especially susceptible to a contagion effect. Understanding how a sanction spills over to neighboring states can help sender states design sanctions that minimize regional disruptions.","Defence and Peace Economics","863-879","7","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2073429","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2073429","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:7:p:863-879","10","GDPE_A_2073429_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

Emergence – instances of sudden and rapid growth of a technical term within the military patent corpus – is found to vary greatly over time. Military technology innovation during the period of 1996-2008 is found to be highly emergent. This period was found to be characterized by high organization-type diversity; non-traditional vendors, traditional defense contractors, large civilian-facing firms, and individuals generated military patents containing many novel emergent technical terms. However, in recent years, military technology innovation has exhibited markedly less emergence. The period of low emergence is characterized by reduced contributions by non-traditional vendors, defense prime contractors, and individual inventors to military patents containing emergent terms. These observations suggest that policies attempting to ensure a healthy defense innovation ecosystem should seek organization-type diversity and may benefit from employing promotion strategies targeted at distinct organization types.","Defence and Peace Economics","1091-1109","8","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2076339","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2076339","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:8:p:1091-1109","11","GDPE_A_2076339_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

The analysis leverages a municipality-representative survey (n ≈ 6,000) that captured self-reported education and income outcomes as well as migration histories. We find that individuals with greater exposure to conflict had systematically worse educational performance and lower earnings two decades after the war. Former external migrants now living in BiH have better educational and economic outcomes than those who did not migrate, but these advantages are smaller for external migrants who were forced to move.

The empirical results reveal that the strong positive impact of democracy and the negative effect of military spending on economic growth exists in the full sample and the cluster of countries with low democratic levels and a high military burden. For democratic countries with low military expenditure, there is a more significant and negative impact both of military expenditure on democracy and vice versa.","Defence and Peace Economics","1039-1070","8","34","2023",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2022.2126955","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2022.2126955","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:34:y:2023:i:8:p:1039-1070","11","GDPE_A_2126955_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20230119T200553 git hash: 724830af20"

We test our propositions on all civil war peace agreements occurring between 1990-2018.

Nevertheless, military spending is highly heterogeneous in its nature consisting of assorted categories that broadly encompass salaries’ payment, operations, training, research and development, and maintenance of equipment, arms and facilities. Naturally, this implies that military spending can affect the economy in various and probably contradictory ways. Hence, by considering this distinctive element of military spending, the present paper aims to uncover the economic effects of the most important components of the US defense budget focusing on a period from 1949 to 2021.

Applying a modified theory of ‘creative insecurity,’ we examine whether the balance between external and internal threats explains the variation in China’s innovation efforts. The hypothesis: when faced with greater threats from abroad than at home, China will have increased its innovation endeavors, measured by its innovation-related policies and research and development (R&D) intensity. Our mixed methods approach finds some support for this hypothesis. Our initial theory, however, seems unable to account for the observation that China also increased its R&D intensity even when external threats decreased and its internal security remained stable. Thus, we introduce a complementary theory of ‘creative ambition,’ which proposes that China’s efforts to innovate may not be merely defensive in nature but also offensive in intent to expand the PRC’s power and influence abroad.

This study examines the likely determinants of public debt in Nigeria over the period 1970–2020 with a focus on the effects of armed conflict, arms imports, and military spending. Unlike most previous studies that focus only on external debt, this study employs the three separate measures of public debt, namely, government gross debt, external debt, and domestic debt. In addition to being more applicable to the case of Nigeria, this also allows us to investigate whether the drivers of public debt vary with the measure of debt used. Employing the ARDL approach to cointegration and a number of robustness checks, findings suggest that whereas conflict, arms imports, and military spending have statistically positive effects on external debt, they do not have a significant effect on domestic debt. Conflict and arms import have positive effects on gross government debt which is unsurprising given that gross debt includes foreign currency denominated debt.

I argue that implementing a third-party verification mechanism of peace accords helps reduce military spending in post-conflict societies because the verification mechanism facilitates the peace accord implementation by enabling reciprocal implementation and by increasing the cost of noncompliance through active information flow. Implementation of peace agreements reduces threats posed by both former and outside rebel groups.

On examining this unique exogenous shock in a 2007-2017 sample of Chinese A-share listed firms, we identify the following effects of CMI on military firms’ performance. (1) The market value of military firms significantly increases after the establishment of the CMI policy in 2015 and the market value of military firms is on average 6.682% higher after 2015. (2) This effect is robust to propensity score matching, instrumental regression, alternative measures of corporate market value.

Generally, NATO defense burden sharing and free riding are judged solely based on ME even though foreign assistance and peacekeeping promote world prosperity, stabilize regimes, and quell conflicts that affect NATO’s collective security. Our parametric tests for free riding apply a spatial-lag panel model, which addresses the interdependency issues, to a broader security-spending measure that accounts for allies’ membership, contiguity, and inverse distance. In all spatial models, we uncover robust evidence of free riding where allies decrease their aggregate security spending in response to increases in the collective security spending of other allies.

NATO is wary of authoritarian states and prepared for the great power competition with them, as shown in its current strategic concept. To prepare for a possible future war against peer competitors, NATO is strengthening its capabilities to conduct MDO, in which cross-domain synergy is a key factor. The model presented in this study relates the cross-domain synergy in MDO and the complementarity between the defense activities in multiple domains using organizational and public economics methods. The implication of this model is that if the defense activities in different domains are complementary, one member country’s increasing defense activities in one domain can increase another’s defense activity in another domain that is complementary to that domain. It is particularly crucial for NATO’s future military buildup: NATO’s approach to MDO will make defense burden-sharing fairer because one member’s military buildup will motivate other members to build up theirs.","Defence and Peace Economics","281-294","3","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2235502","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2235502","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:3:p:281-294","04","GDPE_A_2235502_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240209T083504 git hash: db97ba8e3a"

Conflict is measured according to the dynamic trajectory of Naxal violence-related fatalities at the district level, distinguishing areas of chronic conflict with those experiencing dynamism in conflict intensity over time. ATT estimates indicate that conflict is associated with a reduction in years of schooling for both genders, though relatively high for girls (by a quarter of a year for girls and by 0.16 of a year for boys), driven by large reductions in school accumulation for girls living in areas of chronic conflict. Results are consistent when adopting different methods, alternative measures of conflict fatalities, and accounting for other conflicts and selective migration. Examining transmission mechanisms suggest that household spending on girls’ education may be de-prioritised amidst conflict, while conflict may also weaken or destroy school infrastructure. Results suggest that policy responses should prioritise girls’ education in areas of chronic conflict, not only in ‘fragile states’ but in countries where conflict remains a subnational concern.","Defence and Peace Economics","320-338","3","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2164913","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2164913","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:3:p:320-338","04","GDPE_A_2164913_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240209T083504 git hash: db97ba8e3a"

Indeed, cost escalation represents a challenge but, in fact, these reforms try to adjust the functioning of defence market rather than questioning the institutional features of this latter. The success of defence acquisition structures also explains their limits. The current organisation of defence market was perfectly adapted to the geostrategic context of Cold War and a technological momentum that favours symmetrical arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Even if these structures still help deliver advanced capabilities, they can be considered as not sufficient to cover all the operational needs of armed forces. The conception of capabilities needs to go beyond a long-term planning while industrial approaches open the way to more agile development and manufacturing.

Since the prospect of achieving strategic autonomy also depends on how ‘local’ current supply chains are, we offer an in-depth investigation of three dimensions related to foreign dependency (company ownership, tender success, supply chain participation). Despite mean scores of non-EU ownership in the range of 25-30% for the EU’s largest defence firms, foreign ownership does not necessarily threaten the EU’s security of supply. Nevertheless, the participation of non-EU firms concerning M&A with high relevance for the EU defence industry increases, as does the share of defence-related EU tenders that are won by non-EU firms. An assessment of four multinational military aircraft programmes further exemplifies that the EU’s defence R&D and production capabilities may critically depend on outside suppliers. We thus find that the importance of non-EU actors for the EU’s defence industry is large and may not easily be mitigated, particularly if commodity imports are considered.","Defence and Peace Economics","427-447","4","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2180588","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2180588","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:4:p:427-447","05","GDPE_A_2180588_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240209T083504 git hash: db97ba8e3a"

Conventionally defence equates to military security, but for Singapore this approach was too limiting. There was a recognition that defence and development were intertwined and accordingly the authorities sought to exploit the synergies from adopting an integrative security approach. Total Defence thus emerged, manifesting itself as a blend of soft ‘social resilience’ elements designed to foster collectivism and national identity, and the harder industrial and technological dynamics of ‘defence capability’. The resulting civil-military overlay, along with the government’s imperative to push the boundaries of innovational endeavour, has enabled Singapore to achieve a remarkable cultural, economic and military transformation. In the process, it has achieved rapid expansion of both defence ‘and’ development, leaving most other contemporary post-colonial states in its wake. Yet, the uncertain and turbulent global environment over recent years has revealed possible emerging fault lines in the Total Defence model that the Singaporean authorities would be well advised to heed, and, if possible, resolve.","Defence and Peace Economics","638-658","5","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2187924","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2187924","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:5:p:638-658","07","GDPE_A_2187924_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240209T083504 git hash: db97ba8e3a"

Just as most MIDs do not escalate into interstate war, most proto-insurgencies never make the key tactical transitions needed to produce the onset of civil war. We separately examine proto-insurgency formation and proto-insurgency escalation to onset. We find that proto-insurgency formation is associated with political persecution, such as denial of access to justice, regime corruption, and mid-range levels of repression. Our theoretical focus is on how state repressive violence creates diffusion effects that push proto-insurgencies toward the tactical transitions that enable the escalation to civil war. Proto-insurgency escalation to civil war onset is driven by high levels of state repressive violence directed against proto-insurgency and its area of origin. This leads to the dispersal of proto-insurgents and the displacement of surrounding populations, inducing the spread of state repression to a larger number of administrative units.

However, the literature usually assumes that commodity prices have linear effects. In this paper, we hypothesize that negative and positive commodity export price shocks can have asymmetric effects: while negative shocks are likely to increase conflict, positive shocks can have a smaller conflict-reducing effect or even increase conflict. We test this hypothesis in a dataset for battle deaths during ongoing civil wars. Consistent with the hypothesis, negative price shocks increase battle deaths, but positive price shocks also have a positive effect. The positive effect is concentrated and becomes significant in countries with weak pre-conflict institutions that experience positive price shocks to fossil fuels. We conclude that a combination of institutional reforms, economic diversification, and price stabilization might reduce battle deaths in fuel-dependent countries with weak institutions.","Defence and Peace Economics","622-637","5","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2191535","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2191535","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:5:p:622-637","07","GDPE_A_2191535_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240209T083504 git hash: db97ba8e3a"

In 2022, despite Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and heightened tension around the world, arms production fell in real terms by 3.5 per cent to $597 billion. The decrease was mostly due to the performance of US companies – still plagued by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic – and not offset by increases in other regions. Notwithstanding the global decrease, arms revenue was still 14 per cent higher than in 2015, the year in which SIPRI started including Chinese arms companies. Procurement plans for the replenishment of stockpiles and modernisation of military equipment deployed by states around the world are mostly not yet reflected in the revenue of the arms industry. In addition to the lengthy time lag between orders and deliveries, many companies have faced challenges in scaling up production.

Although only performing numerical calculations, the model predicts the existence of a concave and single-peaked relationship between aggregate R&D and industry structure, making it desirable to adjust concentration in order to reach that peak.

Overall, we find a public preference for arms exports constrained by ethical concerns – a preference that is often at odds with governments’ export practice.

A direct consequence of the completion of anti-satellite military tests is that the amount of orbital debris has increased significantly. We use a simple physical – economic model to illustrate how anti-satellite military tests, particularly those using direct-ascent weapons, dramatically increase the probability that the Kessler syndrome will occur. Whereas the long-run impact of low altitude anti-satellite tests is limited because of atmospheric drag, at high altitude direct-ascent anti-satellite tests are persistently harmful for human activities in space.

This study’s findings indicate that increased military spending has generally reduced default risk in the examined countries, but that excessive military spending, past a certain threshold, can have strong detrimental impacts on the probability of sovereign debt default. Additionally, the findings show that the country’s levels of democracy and foreign currency reserves level are both negatively linked to debt default risk, whereas default history, level of external debt, and short-term debt to reserves ratio are all significantly positively linked to higher default risk. The study suggests that certain countries may wish to evaluate their level of military spending to ensure it is not too high. Alternatively, countries may lower their accrual of external debt from military spending by focusing on domestic arms production, mitigating their risk that way.","Defence and Peace Economics","846-864","7","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2188386","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2188386","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:7:p:846-864","10","GDPE_A_2188386_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240625T135222 git hash: cf9af5b024"

However, the connection between these variables has hardly been analyzed quantitatively. This is due, in part, to the scarcity of statistical data on military technology. This paper has constructed this indicator for the case of Spain based on patents registered in the country. This has allowed us to conduct a VAR model analysis to explore the relationship between defense spending and military technology and between the latter and the modernization of the armed forces from the late 19th century to the eve of the Civil War. Estimates have revealed that defense spending did not have a causal effect (in the Granger sense) on military patents, but there was a relationship in the opposite direction; that is, technological innovation preceded spending. In addition, it has been found that the patents that most influenced spending were foreign patents. On the other hand, there is evidence of a positive effect of military patents on the modernization of the armed forces, with foreign patents being the most influential in this case as well.","Defence and Peace Economics","883-907","7","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2198912","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2198912","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:7:p:883-907","10","GDPE_A_2198912_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240625T135222 git hash: cf9af5b024"

These entente-like alignments make no formal pledges of armed support in the event of hostilities. However, they do not entirely rule out military support either. Why might states embrace this form of strategic ambiguity over firm alliance commitments? Our formal explication addresses this question via the prism of collective action. Our modeling efforts, combined with historical precedents, suggest that an entente might be a more effective alignment choice than a formal alliance for states to balance against powerful threats. An entente permits states to strike the middle ground between entrapment and deterrence. The strategic ambiguity inherent in these two seemingly self-contradictory goals of an entente is a key component of its success as an alignment strategy, especially when external threats are large.

Second, there is no arms race among the countries examined, but only unilateral effects. Third, there is consistent evidence of a possible military spending equilibrium, in the absence of friction between the countries involved (peace threshold). Our findings have important policy implications as they indicate, first, that each country in the region should not determine its level of military spending considering only operational factors, but also considering the signaling of its military spending on its neighboring countries and, second, that there is space for peaceful solutions regarding disputes in the Southeast Mediterranean region.","Defence and Peace Economics","865-882","7","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2241122","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2241122","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:7:p:865-882","10","GDPE_A_2241122_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240625T135222 git hash: cf9af5b024"

Using the recently developed method of Dynamic Autoregressive Distributive Lag (DARDL) simulation proposed by Jordan and Philips (2018) and the Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) technique which accounts for potential non-linearities, interactions, and heterogeneous effects, this paper tests the short and long – run equilibrium relationship between military expenditure and economic growth in Spain. Furthermore, with the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) tests, we examine the stability of the above relationship.

Published estimates vary implausibly from one quarter of the USA’s defense budget to near parity, and there are very few attempts to understand how its size or composition has changed over time. This paper uses index number techniques to quantify China’s real defense spending over time and relative to the USA. I construct price deflators and show that overall growth has been slower than thought, but also that there has been extremely rapid growth in real military equipment spending that has transformed China’s defense forces. China’s real defense purchasing power is also found to be 60% larger than commonly used market exchange rate estimates and equal to 59% of the USA’s defense budget in 2021. Notwithstanding the rapid growth in equipment, the high relative purchasing power mostly reflects China’s far larger number of active personnel.","Defence and Peace Economics","809-825","7","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2342043","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2342043","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:7:p:809-825","10","GDPE_A_2342043_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20240625T135222 git hash: cf9af5b024"

Using econometric analysis, Benmelech et al. (2015) suggest that this policy is effective, citing deterrence as the driving factor. In 2014, the Israeli Supreme Court relied on the findings of an earlier draft of the Benmelech paper to reject a petition against the resumption of punitive housing demolition. In this research, I show that the Benmelech findings are spurious due to misspecified modelling and that the reported effect of punitive house demolition camouflages confounding factors. I also show that among the multiple security measures put in place during the Second Intifada, arrest campaigns did negatively impacted suicide bombings. I provide suggestive evidence that explains individual motives for suicide bombings and why punitive house demolition lacks a deterrence effect. The motives are likely related to the aggravation of grievances from excessive state oppression, willingness to exact revenge, and the glorification of self-sacrifice and martyrdom in asymmetric conflict.","Defence and Peace Economics","1070-1101","8","35","2024",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2023.2289000","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2023.2289000","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:35:y:2024:i:8:p:1070-1101","11","GDPE_A_2289000_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20241014T214545 git hash: 1c0ca8d1ee"

In this paper, we utilize satellite data (nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration and nightlight intensity) and spatial mapping tools to provide a swift analysis of how the conflict has changed the patterns on economic activity, which are bound to have severe implications on food security in Sudan. We show that immediately after the outbreak of the armed conflict, NO2 concentration and nightlight intensity reduced in those areas affected by the conflict while remaining stable in those areas not directly affected by the conflict.

Survey-based data on WPI from 1992 to 2005 and SD organization violence demonstrate that higher WPI associates with an increased probability of an SD organization using violence against other SD organizations. The association is driven by situations in which an SD organization within the SD movement previously used violence against the state. The findings are robust to secondary analysis at the ethnic group level, inclusion of additional covariates, sensitivity tests for omitted variable bias, various model specifications, subset analyses, matching techniques and tests for reverse causality.

The objective is to scrutinize the impact of geopolitical considerations on trade protectionist measures. Our investigation reveals that the escalation of geopolitical risks amplifies the proclivity of nations to engage in trade interventions. As geopolitical uncertainties spread and disagreements arise among traditional trade partners, countries characterized by superior institutional quality, greater political system heterogeneity, and deeper reliance on foreign trade are increasingly inclined to institute trade restrictions as a safeguard for their industries in response to geopolitical tensions.

This paper addresses this problem with two instruments for military expenditures: the value of arms imports during periods of peace and the number of neighboring states suffering interstate violence. While positively correlated with military expenditures, the value of arms imports is unlikely to be determined by economic growth because of the time lag which exists, which in many cases runs into several years, between the placement of purchase orders for these arms and their delivery. The number of neighboring states suffering interstate violence captures regional ‘political uncertainty’, which spurs military spending without capturing the actual scale of domestic political violence which may directly affect economic growth. Several diagnostic tests show that both these instruments are highly correlated with military expenditures and fulfill overidentification restrictions. The results from empirical analyses of panel data on 133 countries during the 1960-2012 period indicate that an increase in military expenditure/GDP of 1 percentage point reduces economic growth by 1.10 percentage points.

Drawing upon a dataset comprising over 150 estimates, the findings of this analysis suggest that there is only a weak, yet statistically significant, negative impact of arms embargoes on arms transfers to target states. This result implies that, on average, arms embargoes are only successful to a limited extent in impeding or reducing the arms trade with these nations. However, the findings also demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity in the embargo effect reported across the primary studies, indicating that certain embargoes still exhibit strong efficacy.

I argue that the costs for mobilizing against armed actors depend on the level of control that armed actors exert in the territory. By examining the civil war in Colombia between 1990 and 2004, I find that civilians protest against the weaker actor to reveal their loyalty to the dominant actor and to prevent the strong side from conducting future violent actions against the population. Protesting works as a costly signal of loyalty. I reveal that non-combatants protest against the stronger actor when both civilians and combatants share the same political ideology. In that circumstance, punishment by the strong combatants is improbable as protesting against them is likely to be interpreted as a renegotiation of the contract or a reminder of its terms.

A hypothetical scenario is analyzed in which the United States has a functioning BMD technology and enough interceptors to distribute them in a two-layer defense with the overall system efficiency of 90%, as targeted by U.S. war planners. It is assumed that the attacker has enough missiles to deliver a range between 500 and 6000 warheads to the continental United States. Results show that in the most optimistic case for the defender, with a very high individual interceptor kill effectiveness of 90% and with perfect decoy discrimination capability, the United States would need to spend on average 8 times more than the attacker, for a total cost between $60 billion and $500 billion.

Furthermore, compared to non-veteran immigrants, Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black immigrant veterans have higher labor incomes or wages, especially for those with a high school education as their highest level of attainment. In contrast, non-Hispanic White immigrant veterans earn less, particularly among individuals with a college education.

The prime contractor commits to generate new business in mutually acceptable sectors equivalent to a large percentage of the project value. Offset multipliers “relax” this constraint by discounting the prime contractor’s offset obligations if investments flow to sectors prioritized by the purchasing country’s industrial policy objectives. This endogenizes the relationship between the original project and the offset contracts. This paper provides a new theoretical analysis of the following three questions that have gone unaddressed in the literature. First, the efficiency of such policies depends on the absorption capacity of a targeted industry. If this capacity is low, import substitution is expensive and the prime contractor may rather choose to invest elsewhere in the economy to satisfy the overall mandatory offset constraint thereby thwarting the original objective. Second, whereas a uniform relaxation of offsets through multipliers can reduce distortions introduced by mandated offsets, multipliers may enhance distortions as an unintended consequence. Third, the prime contractor’s response to offset credit incentives may be weak due to transaction costs arising from having to find new domestic partners to satisfy the offset requirements and manage the contracts.","Defence and Peace Economics","469-492","4","36","2025",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2378278","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2378278","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:36:y:2025:i:4:p:469-492","05","GDPE_A_2378278_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20250326T224308 git hash: 0183536115"

Drawing on a donor pool of low-income and lower-middle-income countries, it constructs a synthetic counterfactual to depict the economic trajectory in the absence of conflict. The analysis reveals a significant decline in national gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, estimated between 45.3 percent and 47.8 percent over a decade of conflict, resulting in a cumulative GDP loss of US$29.7 billion to US$32.4 billion (purchasing power parity, PPP, adjusted). Two model specifications are employed, one using pre-treatment outcomes and the other integrating external covariates. Robustness checks support the findings, indicating a minimum 10-year decline of 35.3 percent in GDP per capita. Even considering the 2003 coup, this civil war has the most detrimental economic impact. The analysis remains robust when incorporating GDP data from remote sensing sources. These effects align with the fragility trap concept, portraying one of the highest economic impacts of civil conflict in terms of relative GDP per capita decline.","Defence and Peace Economics","435-468","4","36","2025",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2385385","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2385385","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:36:y:2025:i:4:p:435-468","05","GDPE_A_2385385_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20250326T224308 git hash: 0183536115"

Thus, this study analyzes the causal nexus between defence expenditure and total factor productivity in the highest defence-spender countries during 1994-2022, employing panel bootstrap Granger causality. The findings suggest that total factor productivity has a significant effect on defence expenditure in China, Germany, Russia, and the UK. Similarly, the results reveal the existence of causality running from defence expenditure to total factor productivity in China, India, Japan, and Russia. Likewise, the results indicate no causal relationships in France, South Korea, and the US implies the presence of other factors for defence expenditure and total factor productivity. The policy recommends a balanced approach to defense expenditure reductions: prioritizing essential capabilities and redirecting savings to investments in productivity.","Defence and Peace Economics","493-508","4","36","2025",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2367410","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2367410","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:36:y:2025:i:4:p:493-508","05","GDPE_A_2367410_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20250326T224308 git hash: 0183536115"

Therefore, the retention of such workers is an important issue for most organisations, including the Royal Navy, which is sensitive to economic pressures from the civilian economy. This paper considers early exits from the Royal Navy as the termination of an individual’s career in the naval force at any time before the termination of their contractual agreement with the organisation. The paper uses a survival analysis model to forecast/predict early exits from the Royal Navy and help build a defence manpower planning tool to manage retentions. At the micro-level, it provides two sets of predictions, the first on who is more likely to leave early, and the second on when that event is most likely to occur. At the aggregate level, the predictive model provides a management tool for performing stress testing in relation to potential changes in economic and labour market conditions and how the heterogeneous skilled workforce within the organisation is likely to respond to different changes.","Defence and Peace Economics","509-532","4","36","2025",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2393917","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2393917","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:36:y:2025:i:4:p:509-532","05","GDPE_A_2393917_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20250326T224308 git hash: 0183536115"

This paper revisits the complex interplay between defence expenditure, political instability, and economic growth in the context of Nigeria, and for the period 1960-2021. Leveraging the robust Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) model proposed by Granger and Terasvirta, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic relationships among these critical factors. Our investigation employs the STAR model to capture potential nonlinearities and regime shifts in these interactions (confirmed by the diagnostic tests), shedding light on how political instability may impact the effectiveness of defence spending on economic growth. The findings further reveal how military spending can influence political stability and governance, particularly in contexts where military resources wield significant power and influence. They also show that low military spending negatively impacts economic growth due to inadequate resources for security and stability maintenance. These findings hold vital implications for policymakers striving to enhance economic development amidst the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and security challenges.","Defence and Peace Economics","533-554","4","36","2025",NA,"10.1080/10242694.2024.2354992","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/10242694.2024.2354992","text/html","Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.","RePEc:taf:defpea:v:36:y:2025:i:4:p:533-554","05","GDPE_A_2354992_J.xml processed with: repec_from_jats12.xsl darts-xml-transformations-20250326T224308 git hash: 0183536115"
